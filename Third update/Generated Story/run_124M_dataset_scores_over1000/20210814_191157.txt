Today is a sunny day. I can see my kids at their bus time. They also plan to play soccer."I'm wondering if that dream of a woman from around here is going to happen. This was the usual scene at my school, until the principal busted down the door and said, "Listen, Super Principalors, I know you're wondering at this point how the district has been clapping on the shoulder, but that's not how today's suspension of activity is. Today's incident has been brought to our attention." Said the principal, as he looked past the second row of students who all seemed to be from district "9". "I'm guessing that we have the surrounding detention center stoided," I said. "Well, I do," the principal said. "What are we waiting for? Anyone else?" He spoke softly. "Just come to class," I said. "No students here." Said the principal.I followed his logic and waited in silence in the halls. I went through to the side room to see where the teacher was. I heard her introduce me in class. She was very young and her blonde hair was down in a ponytail. She must be the apprentice, I whispered to myself."Excuse me is this your idea?" I asked. "My ideas?" My legs wavered in the struggle. "No, actually, we're here for your little game." She quickly glanced over her shoulder and looked back with bemusement. "We don't part with you because everyone in the class enjoys the game." She said matter-of-factly. "If you're a serious DM's dungeon master this is perfectly game. If you are like me you will have played the game long enough and then it ends. The rules are all in place and you will have the opportunity to complete the dungeon out of free labor. If you're that dumb why don't you leave the class alone?" She asked, somewhat coyly.After a short while she numbly sighed, turned around, and began to walk away. "Hey, you feeling alright?" I asked as I walked towards her. "Oh, yes! It's fantastic just splendid!" She said, stuffing her feet back into bed. "I even had cookies today. I'll pay you a visit," she said. "How can I leave the class building?" I asked. "I'll help you out of this, so come to my office and we'll get on things. There's something you should try," She said. "Wish me to stay and review the dungeon's flow," I said. "Sounds like a pretty imaginative idea," She said. Edit: I want to throw a continuation comment but my inbox is empty so I'm posting it anyway. "Each class has one more minute except for a few months where we make an announcement and in that moment I become aware of it and that remains true."That's all that i have to add...  :p    Class: Teacher Demon       -------------------The bell signaled it. It was the moment at which all students had to leave for work. That, and true, a test. I sat quietly in the back, pre-occupied from work on today's lesson, as my friend, Gary, walked out the back door.         As always, I had my head shoved against the back window. "Stay there!" I screamed. It was the worst sound i could be expected to hear.         All i could do was cough, and cough uncontrollably. I'd never feel the urge to cough in the queue before today.         The teacher stopped, looked at me, and shushed me. For five minutes, neither of us said anything. There was a moment where I couldn't move, and then... gone.     After five minutes,
