“I’m sorry,” said Harry. “I’ve got an owl.” 

“Oh, we’ve got an owl.” 

“Sorry?” said Hermione, looking alarmed. 

“Oh,” said Harry, “we’ve got an owl.” 

“Well,” said Hermione in a silvery voice, “we’ll find out. 
This place isn’t for owls, is it? We’re supposed to be 
seeing people.” 

“And what’s that supposed to be?” asked Ron, looking 
very interested. 

“That’s a subject for another post.” 

“Oh,” said Hermione, waving a hand over her 
speech. “Well, well,” she muttered, “well, I’m not 
sure we’ll need to find out anything else about the 
holidays, are we?” 

“Of course not,” said Ron. 

“It’s been a busy year,” said Hermione, looking 
slightly crestfallen. “And I’m afraid to say that 
there’s been a bit of a drop-off in the number of owls 
that’ve been sent to us.” 

“Where’s the drop-off, anyway?” said Ron. 

“Well, that’s what’s happened to the number of letters 
in our school.” 

“Oh, I’m sorry,” whispered Hermione. 

“Well, I’m sorry,” said Ron, “but you’re a bit 
incomprehensible. I’m sorry to come to that now, but 
the number of letters we get — ”

“ — is not necessarily the same as the number of 
students.�
====================
“Oh,” said Hermione, as Ron and Harry opened the door, which had been 
still closed. “that’s what you want.” 

“I’m not paying attention,” said Ron, “I don’t like the 
ways things are arranged.” 

“Hermione,” said Hermione, “I’m sorry — ” 

“I’m sorry,” said Ron. He pushed a paper past her and 
paused, then turned and walked back down the 
stairs. 

“Oh,” said Hermione. “Well, that’s quite the problem, 
isn’t it?” 

“I’m sorry,” said Ron, “but I’ve got to finish your essay 
and I’m going to have a good laugh.” 

“I’ll be glad when I’ve finished it,” said Hermione, 
who had asked Ron for help with her essay, “me 
and Mr. Lovegood will have a good laugh.” 

“Oh, well, I’ll just go back to having fun,” said 
Ron, staring at her. 

“Oh, I’ll come back,” she said, patting his arm and 
looking around at the empty air. “It’s really not 
that horrible.” 

“No, it isn’t that,” said Ron, frowning slightly. “I 
just want to finish it.” 



Page | 486 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Oh, we’ll find another way to finish it,” said Hermione 
with a sigh. “Lovegood’s essay was superb.” 

“Yeah,” said Ron, looking up at her, “just like that.” 

“I’ll write,” she said, “and then I’ll slip on some bit of
====================
” Hermione said quietly, as though this was something they should all be doing.  "All right, 
Professor, these are things that we can all put in 
cover-ups for.” 

“Yes, Professor,” said Ron, “there’s a difference. 

Before you throw them away, I’m afraid I think it’s time 
you’re going to start telling us things, and you’re going 
to start telling us things about the D.A.” 

“Oh,” said Hermione, looking worried. “Yeah, I think we’ll 
need to.” 

“It’s our job to stop you talking about the D.A.,” said 
Ron dryly. “That’s the biggie.” 

“We’ve got to,” said Hermione, for Ron and 
Hermione had been exchanging looks for a moment. 
“Later,” said Ron, and they hurried away without 
themselves. 

“Oh,” said Harry, feeling slightly disappointed. 

“Well, you’ll find out soon enough, we’ve got a nice 
cliff to follow,” said Ron, glancing down at the 
and waiting for the rest of the school to move. “All good. 
You’ll be able to follow us all the way back and you’d 
know what you’re in for before the D.A.?” 

“Yeah, well, I’ve been looking forward to getting to know 
you all, even if I don’t think you’d get along with the 
school’s staff.” 

“Goodness, I’ve been looking forward to a change,” 
said Ron, though his face was not moving as he said 
more quietly. “Well, I’ve decided I’d rather be as good a 
teacher as Dumbledore’s ever given, though. He 
has given me a lot of good advice, he’s
====================
 

“He’s been trying to find out how to get in,” said 
Harry, checking his watch to see if Ron had yet 
died, “because he’s got a month to go.” 

He was half expecting Ron to tell him that the sun was 
barely level, but Harry ignored it, and waited for 
Ron to drop back into the kitchen. 

“I’m starving,” Ron told Harry, waving his hand as 
they went through the grate. “I’ve just been sitting here for 
hours, and the only thing I’ve found is it all comes back to 
it when I pack up my things.” 

“Why?” said Harry. “Why — why ‘I’m starving — ?” 

“Because you don’t have to leave for hours at a time,” 
said Ron furiously, “because I can’t.” 

“That’s a good point.” 

“I think I’ll go back to school,” said Harry, 
pointing to the distant campsite. He had the 
impression that the other eleven wanted to hear 
everything that Ron had said, but had not managed to 
find a single word of it that could be interpreted by 
the other twelve. 

“But I’m starving,” said Ron tentatively. 

“Listen,” said Harry, “we’re in the second year,” 

Page | 615 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




and the other four were all still staring at their 
overheated kitchen. “I dunno if we’re in the fourth year, 
though. ...” 

“I’m not taking part in Potions,” said Ron, 
his hands still shaking slightly. 

“I thought it was a bit more fun if you caught the 
footsteps.” 

“I’d still like to get to know you
====================
Look where you’re going,” said Harry, taking a deep 
breath, “you’re not going to be able to 
find anything. You’d better get going,” he added, 
pointing toward the forest, where a line of small, 
distant trees stood in the shadow of a great, 
horribly overhanging tree. “The sky’s got gray, 
and there’s nothing to see.” 

“You’re not going to find anything at all, you’re 
doing it wrong,” said Harry. 

“Well, I’ll try,” said Ron, “and if I were you’d I 
remember how we were, we’re supposed to be 
looking for those dementors?” 

“Yes,” said Harry, “but it’s got to be the same 
one who’s guarding the cup.” 

“What’s that, come on,” said Ron, looking undecided 
from whence he was coming and looking at the dark, 
darkness. “Is that a Death Eater?” 

“Yeah,” said Harry. 

“So we’re going to need to get out of here in the 
morning,” said Ron, dropping his voice to a whisper. 
“And we’ll need to think about what to do next, 
because the last thing we’ll want to do is find the 
Dementors.” 

“Dementors?” said Harry, horrified. “They’re 
falling all over the place, don’t you know?” 



Page | 827Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Nah, we should check our Marauder’s Map,” said 
Ron, “we’ve got to check where we’re going, you 
know where we’re going, we don’t need to worry.” 

====================
written by the 
wizards themselves, I thought the most 
important lesson to learn was — ” 

“The thing is, don’t tell anyone,” said Ron, “and 
ask them not to tell anyone.” 

“You’re not supposed to tell them, are you?” 
said Hermione. 

“Well, of course not,” said Ron. “If they do, I’m 
dumbstruck to find they’re nearly as stupid as you 
are.” 

“It’s not that they don’t like you,” said Hermione, 
“it’s that they think you’re a mongrel, you’re a 
mongrel — ” 

“Mongrel?” said Ron. 

“Oh, I’m sorry,” said Hermione, unable to say another 
word. 

“Oh yes,” said Ron, looking rather resentful. “Yes, 
the thing is, don’t tell anyone, and ask them not to 
tell anyone, and ask them not to tell anyone.” 

“What about you, Ron?” asked Hermione, looking 
rather resentful. 

Ron’s lip was very shallow. He had been staring 
around at the deserted room. There were no more 
people than there were in the castle, and he was 
causing a great deal of discomfort by being the one who 
had told Ron where to go. 

“I’m sorry to intrude,” said Hermione quietly. “I 
don’t think it’s right for us to be leaving until you 
have finished, and I’m sure you’re going to be 
helping us tonight, and I’m sure you’re not going to 
mention me as a wizard when we’re finished with you. 
But if you don’t want to — ” 

“Oh, I’m sure you’re not going
====================
“Why did you say ‘him?” 

“Because he’s a Death Eater,” said Ron, though 
he looked positively alarmed. “And I know I 
should have known it was coming.” 

“ ’Course you should,” said Hermione impatiently. 

“You’re not Death Eaters, are you?” said Ron, 
dropping his voice as he looked at Lupin. 

“We’re Death Eaters, not regular Death Eaters.” 

“Yeah, we’re,” said Lupin. 

“We’re supposed to be your guard,” said Hermione 
impatiently. 

“Yeah, we’re,” said Ron fiercely. “But we can’t let you 
live, can we?” 

“Yeah,” said Lupin, “we’ve got to start somewhere, 
something like a Ministry post.” 

“ ’Course we can’t do that,” said Hermione in a 
low voice, looking at Hermione rather than Ron. 
“Hermione, I think we’ve got to go and try and persuade 
you that this isn’t a joke.” 

“I’m trying to use that place as a base,” said 
Hermione, as she turned and headed back toward the 
corner of the stone pit. 

The sun had now risen. 



Page | 853 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“I’ve told you, he’s really in the Order,” said Tonks 
furiously, “and I’ve told you before,” she giggled, and 
she led the way over the frozen ground toward the 
corner of the little black rock. The starlight was 
completely useless against the 
darkness. 

“Sirius’s back,” said Tonks. 

“Yes?” said
====================
“Don’t worry,” said Hermione, “don’t worry. ...” 

“I’m just saying,” said Hermione, her eyes 
open, “that if you keep your head down and 
look at everything, you’ll get a Highly-Educational 
Grade.” 

“No,” said Harry, “maybe that’s what you’re 
supposed to get,” and he said it simply, without 
thinking. 

“Well, I’ll see you around,” said Hermione, and she 
and Ron left the dungeon together. 

“I’m sorry to have to leave,” said Ron, as Harry and 
Hermione came back out of the door. “I thought we 
were going to keep it quiet about it.” 

“You’re right,” said Harry, “but I thought it might 
have been a bit more interesting if we’d found out what 
Charms was all about.” 

“We’re not talking about the enchantments!” said 
Hermione. “The Ministry has put a lot of work into 
Charms, and we’re going to have to tell them what 
happened when that dementor came back.” 

“Yeah, well,” said Harry, “we’re just trying to keep our 
mouth as clean as possible, you know, don’t take too 
much of a risk.” 

“And what’s that going to be like, anyway?” 

“It’s a matter of time before we’re getting a 
Disillusionment Charm, and that’s when we need to 
think about getting an A.” 

Page | 719Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Yeah,” said Hermione, “but we’ll be able to.” 



“We’ll be able to,�
====================
Harry stared at him.

"I promise you," said the Malfoys' voice suddenly, "I'll be back to see you.  I promise I'll be with you.  It is six o'clock, and we're going to feast."
The door at the end of the hall creaked open; the three Gryffindors stood there, still gaping at Harry, puffy-eyed and pale, their faces.
"Every night now they'll have breakfast," said Ron, patting Harry's arm.  "We all need to get going, and it's nearly midnight, so we need to pass the torch."
Harry, Ron, and Hermione went to sit down next to the fire.  Hermione kept looking at Ron with her mouth wide open, as though she was trying to say something to make him stop.  Harry watched her go, but he thought she might have been trying to make him forget that she couldn't have remembered.
"What's he miss?"  Ron said anxiously.  "Why?"
For a fraction of a second, Harry thought Ron might have said, "I don't know" - but then he said, "I don't think he's very nice -" and he added, "I can't remember what I've done last night."
For a moment, Harry thought he had managed to say "I miss you" twice, but then he said, "I'm not having all the nightmares I used to have."
"Well, that clears that up," said Hermione, "we're not having nightmares anymore, are we?"
"Well, we're not being very nice," said Ron.  "It's okay to be nice to us both.  You know, we've had our fair share of trouble lately -"
"We're not having trouble!"  Harry snapped at him.  "We're just -"
"We're just thinking about what happened the night we met," said Ron.  "We just thought it was a wonderful Christmas gift.  We just thought it was the perfect way to end our Christmas.  It was.  We'll see you all next year, won't we?"
He looked down at his watch.  "We don't know what you're thinking, though -"
"I was just thinking," said Harry, "if you can't do anything about Christmas, how's that going to help?
====================
“And what’s that, 
Harry?” 

“A little-known contribution to the Order,” said 
Dumbledore. “One of his favorite students, 
he has the knack of spotting errors in the code 
that are too often overlooked.” 

“So ...” said Harry. “So what’s that?” 

“A small black object traveling in a circle around 
the sun. In our solar system, the sun is only 
about four times more massive than it is today. It 
calls upon those who have shared our solar system to 
attend its happy brawls.” 

“Hmm. No sign of a solar flare yet, though.” 

“Well, if the sun is a bit larger than our planet, it’s a bit 
small for it to be observing the sun’s activity. But 
we’ve got the moon, and if it’s a bit smaller than our moon, it’s 
not much to do with our solar system either. In fact, 
we’ve got a lot more sun than our moon.” 

“And why should we care?” said Harry. 

“Because our sun is the only living thing in the universe. It 
is the only living thing.” 

“So,” said Dumbledore, “the wizard who taught you 
the importance of the sun, the one who found it 
in the Horcrux, has been right — and I am 
thrashing against the will of those who are keeping 
it secret — ” 



Page | 294 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“I’m just saying,” said Harry, “that when we think of 
the deaths of two of our favorite students, we think 
of the mysterious Death Eaters.” 

“But — ” 

“There are other things in Death Eaters’ records. 
For one thing, there are no eyewitness accounts of how 
these things happened.
====================
“Are you happy to meet me?” asked Harry. 

He looked around. What with the brambles and 
flames and the runes and Ron’s hood, Harry had 
found himself face-to-face with a particularly 
shabby old man. He was wearing dirty clothes, 
but his face was very pale and very unpleasant. 

“Well ... I’m sorry to have to take you to such an 
inconvenient time,” he said. He gave a great, 
shriveling laugh and then, with a swift, sweeping 
movement, he swept from the room, leaving Harry 
standing on the spot. 

“You are very much looking forward to meeting us here, 
Harry,” said Slughorn, when Harry had finished 
her questioning him. “We will be pleased to be able to 
send you drinks.” 

“Er ... yes,” said Harry, sitting down again. 

“The first stop,” said Slughorn, “will be at the front 
door. It is a short walk from here. If there is an 
object waiting outside, we will be able to find it. 

Page | 838 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Ogwarts Ministry of Magic, but no sooner did I 
pass the Department of Mysteries, than the 
window will be the only one in which the object can be 
found.” 

“Something for looking at?” said Slughorn. “Something 
of the unexpected?” 

“Yes,” said Harry, who was looking at something 
that was waiting for him outside the door, and which 
was holding something that looked great and 
precident. 

“Another object? Something for looking at?” 

“Yes,” said Harry. “Something that will allow you 
to see what is happening outside the Ministry of Magic. 
You will need to have the Horcrux, of course.” 

“Yes,” said Harry, “
====================
“No,” said Ron, as Harry leaned in closer, “I’ve got the idea, I’ve got the idea — ” 

“Yes,” said Harry, and suddenly he was looking down at 
Hermione. “How did you get this?” 

“I’ve been looking for it for hours, and you’re looking for it!” 

“Oh,” said Hermione. 

“I’ve just been thinking about it!” said Ron. 
“Oh, it’s your idea!” 

“That’s lovely of you,” said Hermione. 

“Let’s try again!” said Ron, and Harry and Hermione 
joined in. 

“I’ve just been thinking about it,” said Hermione 
dismissively. “I’ve just been thinking about the idea of 
having a go at the whole Kendra’s family, and having 
Ron’s family.” 

“I’ve always thought that’s a bit on-topic,” said 
Harry, who was staring at the floor, 

Page | 811Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




making a very terse noise, “that’s the idea, is it?” 

“Yeah,” said Hermione, “but how come we’re going 
to have the whole family’s wedding?” 

“I’ve never been told what to do,” said Harry, “because 
the Top Box’s never been opened.” 

“Excuse me?” Harry asked, but Hermione did not 
reply, and before he could say anything more about the 
top-secret box in the corner, Ron dropped his 
inspiration into the lumpy mass in the corner. 

“D’you know about what?” 

“I don’t,” said Hermione. “But if
====================
“There’s no — ” 

“No,” said Harry. 

“Is there?” asked Ron, throwing his weight at 
Hermione’s shoulder. 

He had a funny feeling the pain had got worse too. 

“You’re stinking!” 

“No,” said Hermione, looking horrified. “I’m 
really sorry to take you so seriously. I’ve been 
thinking about this for ages. I’m going to have to go and 
get you back from the hospital wing.” 

“You’re not the only one.” 

“I’m going back!” 

“I’m going back!” 

“I’m not going back!” 

“I’m not going back!” 

And she punched him in the face. 



Page | 795 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“It’s not fun, you know!” 



“No,” said Harry, “I’m not going back! I was 
telling you to leave. You’re disgusting, you’re 
stinking — ” 

“I’m not going back, I’m just going to go and get 
you,” said Hermione. “You’re a nice person, 
Hermione.” 

“I’m not going back either,” said Harry, “I’m 
not pretending. I’m just going to find a way to say 
Dumbledore’s name. I’ve got a feeling we’ll see 
him soon.” 

Harry shook his head, thinking of Ron’s 
last meeting with Dumbledore, and wishing that he would 
see Ron again. 

“Harry, I don’t like you too much.” 

“Get out of the way,” said
====================

For the last few days, the headmaster of Riddle High School has been sending students to the Junior History of Magic class.
The Daily Prophet's article about the class's existence was reported last night, but part of the story
— that students were being sent to History of Magic and Notable Mischief — was that History of Magic wasn't being held
within Riddle. According to the Prophet, other schools have tried to do the same.
"History of Magic doesn't need to be held inside Riddle," said an incredulously
flustered Percy Weasley, who had come from a school like Riddle. "It's inside his head, and it's all
around you. You don't have to go through all that trouble. I'll give you one
lesson. . . ."
"I'm not going to tell you what to do," said Fred Weasley, his voice
rising, "I'm going to give you one more lesson. But I think it would be a good idea to
ask Professor Moody about that History of Magic class."

Percy Weasley gestured toward the front page of the paper. Percy Weasley
was glowering at Fred Weasley, who was clutching a piece of parchment.

"Get out of the way," said Percy, who was leaning against the window,
sitting on a stool. "Riddle's got an old Quidditch team and it's coming to
Hogwarts."

The students in the front row were all staring at Percy.

"See?" Percy whispered, "Riddle's house is on a very small hill. I could
have bet a hundred and fifty-fifty that was Riddle's house."

"What's that supposed to mean?" said Fred Weasley, glowering at Percy.
"Riddle's house is on a very small hill?"

"A hill, I'm afraid to say," said Percy, speaking in a whisper. "Riddle's
family village is on a very small hill. Probably near the bottom of the
river. I distinctly remember him saying to his old team, 'If we keep going,
we'll attract more Muggles, if we keep attracting Muggles, and we'll be able
to get you to school."

Percy looked at him.

"But how do you know where that old
====================
” 

“I’ll see you next time!” said Hermione. 
“I am hopeful!” 

She marched off, leaving Harry and Ron to stare at 
each other over the top of the tent. 

“I would like to be here in a bit,” said Ron, when 
he had reached the door. 

“So we can start the task now,” said Hermione 
carefully. “We’re going to have to be very careful, 
remember?” 

“You’re going to have to be careful,” said Harry 
impatiently. 



Page | 248 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“No,” she said simply. “Our precautions are very 
important. We have to be very quick to guarantee the safety 
of our guests.” 

Ron and Hermione exchanged looks about the tent. Ron 
jumped to his feet. 

“What are we going to do?” Harry asked. 

“Well, we’ll just keep going.” 

“Don’t ask questions,” said Hermione, “we’re a 
family.” 

“What’s going on?” 

“I don’t know.” 

“Oh,” said Ron, “right. Well, all right, let’s do it.” 

“Okay,” said Hermione, and she led the way out 
into the dimly lit grounds. 

Harry was not in much of a mood when they entered. 
He had been thinking... He wanted to say 
something to Hermione, but the idea of not telling her 
anything he had seen in the Prophet’s last report 
made him feel rather unpleasantly sad. The Prophet was 
probably the most important source of fresh information on 
the whole thing about Voldemort being caught and released 
from Azkaban. He wanted her to know that he was 
giving them that very very powerful Patron
====================
” said Hermione, “you’d better 
let them know you’ve got them. So put that 
note under the table, or they’ll be talking about 
what you’ve been writing.” 

“Well, I want them to talk about what you’ve been 
writing about,” said Harry. “So let’s put that note under the 
table.” 

“Professor?” said Hermione, looking suspicious. 

“Well, I’d better tell them what’s going on,” said 
Harry. 

“Professor,” said Hermione, “Professor, you’ve got to 
let them know you’ve been writing about 
Horcruxes for years.” 

“Well, I’ve done,” said Harry, “I’ve got to let them talk about 
Horcruxes in the corridors at Hogwarts.” 

“You can’t,” said Hermione, looking alarmed. “Professor 
— ” 

“I’ve got nothing to tell them,” said Harry, and he 
scribbled something on it in his mind. 

“Horcrux experts have been calling you in in the 
corridors for years, and you’re the only one who’s 
getting rid of them.” 

“C’mon!” said Ron. “It was a mistake!” 

“It was!” said Hermione, tears welling still in her 

Page | 464 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




throat, as she started to write again. “I’ve been 
counting points, you know, because it’s been 
too long, I’ve had so many involvements — ” 

“ ‘I’ve got points,’ ” said Harry. “I’ve been trying to 
count them all the time, but I’ve never managed
====================
“You’re that ugly,” said Harry. 

“Yeah,” said Fred. “I’ve got to say, Harry, it’s 
really surprising.” 

“Yeah, it’s exactly what he was hoping for,” said 
George. 

“Are you, ‘Are you, Harry?” asked Fred. 

“Oh yes,” said Harry, “I’d thought it would be 
like Ron and Hermione to tell us, but we were like 
“You’re so naive, it’s all about the journey, it’s 
not easy, don’t you think?” 

“Yeah,” said George, “but I don’t think you’d ever 
had a story like ‘You’re a giant, come on.’’ ” 

“Yeah, I’d love to hear them,” said Fred. 

“Listen,” said George, “it’s just been really 
interesting.” 

“Yeah, I’ve been giving you stuff,” said Harry. 
“But I don’t really have a clue what’s going on, 
or what ‘danger’ means anymore.” 

“Well, from what you’ve said about the ‘dangers’ — ” 

“I mean, the journey’s dull, it’s just been really 
interesting,” said George. “Yeah, we’ll see.” 

“I’ll, I’ll, we’ll see,” said Fred. 

“Yeah, we’ll see,” said George. “I’ll be back for 
the third task.” 

Page | 764 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Okay,” said Fred, stretching out on the landing, 
and the three wizards followed Fred
====================
“Look,” said Harry, in an 
impressive voice, “let’s see, we’ve got an idea of what we 
need, now get back to the drawing board.” 

The others groaned, but the ground remained unruffled 
as they did their best to keep up the pressure on the 
surrounding bushes. Ron and Hermione were so 
suddenly and imperceptibly present with the idea of 
Harry’s argument with Hermione that they were 
unable to speak to them immediately afterward. 
Hermione was still in utter disbelief, but Harry, 
who had given the idea that she was the one who had 
exercised the incantation of “Tut-Tu-Wan,” was 
impressed. He had had her answer before, but it was 
unlikely to persuade her; there was a chance that she 
might have thought it had been her, not Ron. 

“Look,” he said, turning back to Harry, “let’s say 
this is true.” 

“Let’s say we’re right,” said Harry, “and this is 
true.” 

“I think,” said Hermione, “that this theory does 
not fit with the facts.” 

“Yes, well, of course it does,” said Ron. “It’s a theory 
that does not yet exist.” 

“But that’s exactly why we’ve got to go back!” 
said Hermione, and she led the way out of the 
seventh row toward the oak front doors. 



Page | 544 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“We’ve got to go!” Harry shouted at the others. 
“The door’s open!” 

“No, we’ve got to go!” 

“You're the one who’s got to go! Now!” 

“Harry, if you’

” said 
Harry, who had not expected the look of great 
apprehension. 

“I’ve been hoping you’d be here.” 

“I’ve been hoping to see you.” 

“I’ve been hoping to hear from you.” 

“You’ve got a new Defense Against the Dark Arts 



“ ’Arry, I’ve got a new Defense Against the Dark Arts 
today.” 

“’Second hand.” 

“The third.” 

“The fourth.” 

“Expect a laugh.” 

“I don’t hate you,” said Harry. “I just want to know 
what we’re doing.” 

He pulled out his wand and shouted,

“You’ve got a new boy!” 

“No,” said Harry, who was starting to get the feeling 
that there were things to be said for his own good, 
but he did not feel like speaking. He wanted to 
speak out loud, and yet, very clearly, he failed. 

“You’ve got another new boy?” he asked, as he 
jumped into the table at the back of the room. 
“Yeah,” said Hermione, looking at him. “Yeah, I 
think we ought to start with that one,” she told Harry, 
and she pulled out a long piece of parchment from 
underneath her hat. “I want to know what he’s been 
up to for a while now, and what’s happened to him. 

“Well, we can’t tell you,” she said, as Harry got to 
his feet again, “because you’re not allowed to tell us 
anything.” 

“What?” said Harry. “Yeah, it’s not our business.” 

“But it’s our business,” said Hermione, “and we’re 
supposed to keep our mouths shut.” 

“Yeah,” said Harry, “but we can’t tell you . . . you’re 
expected to keep a quiet line.” 

Page | 569 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Aren’t we supposed to keep our mouths shut?” 



“We’re not supposed to keep our mouths shut,” said 
Hermione. 

“We’re supposed to keep our eyes shut,” said Harry 
confidently, but Hermione sidled away from him, still 
looking rather anxious. 

“I don’t know whether it’s a good idea for us to do it as 
usual, but we’ve got to be ready for anything.” 

�
====================
” he said, as 
Snape emerged from behind the bushes, “the 
Uniform Maintenance Department has been 
broken into by Death Eaters.” 

“Yeah,” said Snape. “Erm . . . do you know 
anything about that place?” 

“Dumbledore stole the wardrobe from Gellert 
Drolly in his sleep.” 

Snape’s eyebrows had risen. 

“And the wardrobe that bore that 
Uniform Maintenance Department’s name was, ‘Ravenclaw 
Enchantments.’ ” 

“And what do you reckon it’s got to do with 
the clothes you wear?” 

“Well, to keep them from falling off,” said Snape, 
“by forcing them into the wardrobe.” 

“But I’m not sure, am I?” 

“Very good,” said Snape, “and that’s the problem. 
You’re the one who’s got to keep your wardrobe 
tight.” 

“I’m going to try and get rid of it,” said Snape 
slowly, “but I’m not quite sure what I’d do, or 

Page | 724 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




get rid of it.” 

“I don’t know why you think it’s a good idea, or 
anything,” said Snape, “but the Cloak’s a lot 
easier than the Cloak of Invisibility, so you’re 
likely to get a lot more Sneak Peekners than I 
give you. We’ve got a couple of Potions Potions 
Potions that really get your attention, Snape, you’ve 
got a very good Potions class.” 

“Yeah, I think so,” said Snape, “but I think it’s a bit 
odd that you’re not a teacher and
====================
” said Harry, “Don’t say it, don’t.” 

“You’re not stupid, you’re not stupid enough to say 
that.” 

“Don’t be stupid,” said Harry. “You’re going to 
see what people think if you’re going to put a stop to 
it.” 

“Well,” said Riddle, “you’ve got to be brave. Otherwise it’s 
going to be a lot worse than the last one.” 

“You’re brave.” 

“I’m not brave,” said Riddle, nodding. “I’m not sure 
why we’re doing this. It’s about time you’ve stopped 
doing it.” 

“I’m not brave.” 

“You’re not brave, I know that. You’re not brave.” 

“No, I’m not going to stop you doing it.” 

“I’m not going to stop you doing it. You’re not going 
to stop me doing it.” 

“You’re not going to stop me doing it, you’re not going to 
stop me doing it.” 

“You’re not going to stop me doing it either.” 

“You’re not going to stop me doing it. You’re not going to 
stop me doing it either.” 

“You’re not going to stop me doing it either.” 

Page | 525 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“You’re not going to stop me doing it either.” 



“You’re not going to stop me doing it either.” 

“You’re not going to stop me doing it either.” 

“You’re not
====================
“But — ” 

“It’s not just me, it’s the whole House,” said 
Harry, “and it’s always good to have a bit of a laugh. I 
came back this morning to find a new password, so I 
can’t forget it, but — ” 

“It’s not funny,” said Tonks, her eyebrows raised. 
“You’re not supposed to be funny.” 

“You’re not supposed to be funny,” said Harry out of 
his frustration. 

“Yeah, I am,” she said, “I know I’m not supposed to 
be funny, Harry, it’s just that I’m used to it.” 

“You’re not supposed to be funny,” said Harry, still 
staring at her. “You’re supposed to be funny.” 

Page | 591 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“What’s funny?” said Tonks, looking at him with an 
expression of deep dislike. “Are you imagining 
me?” 

“I’m sorry,” said Harry, “I mean, are you?” 

“You’re lying, aren’t you?” asked Tonks. 

“No,” said Harry, “I’ve been thinking about that for 
hours.” 

“Well, you’re kidding,” said Tonks. “I never 
brought that up with you.” 

“Yes, two years ago, I brought it up with a friend who 
was very interested in the Dark Arts,” said Harry 
furiously. “And then I met a friend who was a Death Eater. 
And I thought I’d like to meet him, like I’d come to 
meet him, like he’s going to be able to help me. I
====================
“I’ve been thinking about it,” said Harry, 
embarrassed. “About what Dumbledore told me 
last night. ...” 

Harry glanced into the cracked mirror and saw Ron 
scurrying toward them out of sight, still holding out 
his hand to Harry. 

“You won’t be able to move my hand, though,” said 
Harry, shaking his fist angrily. “It won’t be 
fast enough.” 

“Yeah,” said Ron, leaning back slightly to look at 
Harry. “But even if you can’t move my hand, what 
d’you reckon it’s going to do to yours?” 

“You’re kidding,” said Harry, “really.” 

“You’re not going to get it,” said Ron, an “I’m sorry,” 
said Harry, looking away from Ron and toward the door 
into the corridor. “You’re going to have to wipe it clean 
every night after that.” 

“I’m not going to wipe it clean after that,” said 
Ron. 

“You’re right,” Harry said, “I don’t think it’s worth it. 
What’s your problem?” 

“Occlumency,” said Harry, “Occlumency doesn’t 
stop at sleep. It can take years to get the right levels of 
excited brain waves.” 

“What?” said Ron, frowning, “Occlumency isn’t a 
problem with mood, is it?” 

Page | 936Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Occlumency isn’t a problem with memory,” said 
Harry. “Mind you, some people forget things at 
times like these, and I’m sure it’s something 
you’d
====================
” 

“I want you to look after yourself,” said Harry, “and I want you to 
keep an eye on your breakfast. The problem is, there’s 
nothing Arthur can do.” 

“I think you’re going to say something about keeping 
sure that’s your problem,” said Ron. 

“I know that’s what you’re doing,” said Harry. “Stay 
close to your parents, they’re the ones who taught 
you.” 

“I want to know what they’re up to,” said Ron. 

“I think it’s better if you’ve learned to trust us rather 
than our parents’ opinions.” 

“Yeah,” said Harry. “Well, I’m going to have to get back 
down to the castle for a bit.” 

“What?” asked Ron. 

“We’re not going to be able to find new temporary 
place to stay.” 

“Yeah,” said Harry. 

“So — we might have to move out of the castle. We’re 
not going to be able to teach anyone new spells.” 

“We’re not leaving the castle to move out of classes!” 
said Ron. 

“No,” said Harry. 

“You’re going to have to move out of your house.” 

Page | 36Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“I’m not going to go and visit the place in question,” 
said Ron. “I’ve got to find another place, find another 
place to stay.” 



“Well, you’re kidding,” said Harry, looking around at the 
shabby yard. 

“No,” said Ron. “We’ve got to find somewhere to stay. 
We’ve
====================
"We have a mission," said Harry. "And our first is to study magic."
"We're going to ask you to help us," said Ron, frowning at the same spot.
"Thank you," said Harry.
"And we'll tell you what -"
"We will," Harry repeated.
"We will. . ."
"You've got to go and tell us, Ron," said Hermione, her eyes still watering.  "I'm going to see you upstairs for your first lesson.  A little bit of homework.  If you need any help with your quill."
"Oh no," said Ron hurriedly.  "You're a prefect."
He pulled out his wand, tapped the map on his hip pocket, and said, "Maple Syrup.  Where are you going?"
"To study magic," said Hermione.
"And you're going to ask us to tell you where to look, too," said Ron, looking from the map to Harry.
Hermione had her hand on the map, but before she could answer, Ron had seized it.
"You're going to tell us how to get inside your head?"
"Oh yeah," said Ron.  "And we're going to tell you the magic that goes inside it.  But first we need to ask you to write down what you're doing.  For instance, how do you get inside your head?"
"I'm going to ask you to say a few words," said Hermione, and her hand zoomed out of Ron's pocket.
"Okay," said Ron, "you need to say what you're doing."
"I'm going to ask you to write down what you're doing," said Hermione.
"Okay," said Ron, "you need to say what you're feeling."
"I'm going to write down what you're feeling," said Hermione with a look of utter desperation.
"Okay," said Ron, "you need to say what you're feeling."
"I'm going to write down what you're feeling," said Hermione.  "I'm going to give you a few tips."
"Okay," said Ron, so quietly that the map took away, "so you're feeling something else?"
"Yeah," said Hermione, her hand still outstretched.  "Just think of something else we'll like to see you try."
"
====================
’s got the right to be confused.” 

“I don’t know,” said Harry 

Page | 564 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Well, why not, eh?” said Ron, as they headed 
up the stairs. “I’ve got a bit of a taste for the 
darkness, you know.” 

“But I’ve got a bit of a taste,” said Hermione 
furiously. 

“What?” said Harry. 

“Oh ... yeah. We’ve got a bit of a taste. We’re not 
really into the Deathly Hallows, we’ve got a taste of the 
Dark Lord’s veins, you’ve got a taste of what 
people eat ...” 

She dropped her voice as she spoke. 

“Yeah, they’ve got a taste,” said Harry. 

“But that’s not how it works, isn’t it?” 

“Yeah,” said Hermione firmly. “It’s information-seeking 
minded people who think they’re getting information from 
the Dark Lord.” 

“But it’s not what I’ve seen,” said Ron. 

“Yeah, it’s not what you’ve heard,” said Hermione 
furiously. “I reckon you’ve got a taste of what he’s 
ready to offer us.” 

“But you’re not hearing him,” said Ron. 

“Well, the Dark Lord’s got a taste,” said Hermione, 
“and he’s ready to offer Dark wizards a taste — a 
taste of something that’s tasty, isn’t it?” 

“The Dark Lord’s already offered us a taste,” said 
Hermione. “So you’d be surprised if he gave you a 
====================
“I’ve been busy,” said Hermione, eyeing Harry hard in the face. 
“You’ll find out tomorrow.” 

“I hope we’re all well,” said Ron, “but we’ve got to come back 
after Slughorn’s departure.” 

“We can’t go back,” said Hermione. “Come on.” 

They set off down the dark corridor, a cold night’s night. 
Ron and Hermione were right; it was the first night Harry had 
ever spent alone with them. The wall behind them was 
narrowed by a curtain, and Harry knew that they 
would need to push their footsteps out of the corridor 
without detection. 

He looked around him as they walked into the Great Hall, 
and saw the House tables, the chairs, and the long table 
standing at the end of the Hall. It was fitting, though 
very strange, that the House tables stood, facing the 
others, facing each other, facing one another. It was 
the same House table, the same height, but with a few 
changes. One of the chairs had been ripped open and 
the substance in it was sucked roughly out of the cork 
by the force of the blow that was coming from the left 
end of the chair. 

“How come you’re okay?” Harry asked the other 
person. 

“Wormtail’s got a funny way of catching it,” said 
the other. 

“Nothing like that,” said the other. 

“Why?” 

“Because he’s got a funny way of catching terrible 
Dark spells,” said the other. 

“Yeah,” said Harry. “Yeah, he’s got a funny way of 
catching things that’s just as bad.” 

Page | 725 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




He looked at Hermione. 



“But how’re
====================
” said Harry, grinning. 
“But anyway, if you don’t want to talk to us, don’t 
ask us!” 

“No, thank you,” said Hermione. “Don’t pause 
for the joke, Hermione.” 

“I’m not getting off on anything,” said Ron, looking 
around at Ginny, who was staring at Fred and 
George. 



Page | 438 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“We’re not going to be overheard telling anyone 
about the meeting, are we?” said Hermione, 
looking slightly alarmed. “I mean, can we get 
out of here?” 

“Oh yeah,” said Ron, jumping up. “You don’t mind, 
aren’t you?” 

“Yeah, we’re really sorry,” said Hermione, looking 
freckened. “Will you let me go and do homework?” 

“No, we’re fine,” said Ron, looking slightly surly. 
“Oh it’s none of your business. We’re going to be 
checking whether you’ve got permission from your 
Minister.” 

“Well, we’ve got the Minister’s blessing,” said 
Ron, giving Hermione a small smile. “But we’re 
going to have to check whether you’re supposed to 
come.” 

“Of course we’re supposed to come,” said Hermione 
apologetically. 

“Yeah, well, we’re about to check whether we 
can’t find a way around the Ministry.” 

“Come on,” said Ron, as Hermione hovered in the 
darkness, “let’s go down to the kitchen and check 
whether we can find a way around the Ministry.” 

“But how can we check?” said Hermione
====================
” said Harry. 
“Hermione said Sirius was a 
Potter, and I’m sure she means you too. But 
the thing is, we can’t stop her.” 

“She’s right,” said Ron. “We’ve got to stop whatever 
we’re doing.” 

“How?” asked Harry, looking from Hermione to 
Ron and back again. 

“It’s because she’s like Sirius and I’ve always 
been like — ” 

“Oh,” said Hermione. “Well, you’re right, we’ve 
got to stop at least one more time, we’ve got to stop 
having to think about it.” 

“We’ve got to stop!” said Harry. “What’s the point?” 

“We can’t stop!” said Hermione, and her voice cracked 
with the force of another yell. “We’ve got to stop — 
we’ve got to stop!” 

She was pointing at the door. 

“Harry,” she said, “you’d better be able to stop me 
going for a walk.” 

“Yeah,” said Harry, “yeah,” and he pushed the 
door open and shut with a bang. 

“Harry?” 

“I’ve got to go to Sirius,” said Harry with 
a desire to say something, but Hermione was 
still staring blankly at the door. “You’d better be 
back soon, will you?” 

“Yeah,” said Harry, but the idea of leaving was far 
far more pressing than leaving Hermione alone. It 
was as he threw the unconscious Fleur back into the 
portrait hole, he lunged for the Invisibility Cloak 
but Hermione leapt aside, her wand pointing at the 
door.

Translator: Unison

Feedback is very good, I hope you will continue to support the D’s!
And now, I beg you, if you would prefer to stay in your dormitory, I would like you to inform the D before you go in your dormitory. 
I will go in here, I can show you how to do it. 

Harry left his copy of Unison to Ron in his bedside cabinet the night before he went to bed. 
He had never written down the tasks that Dumbledore had asked him 
to do before leaving Dumbledore’s office. He was sure that there had 
been more than one before, but there were certainly at 
least one before this one. 

“You’re going to be through with all the tasks tonight,” said Ron 
brusquely. “And you’re going to be giving us the password to the 
portrait of the Fat Lady!” 



Page | 468Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“What?” said Harry, impressed. “You’re going to use 
that?” 

“Yeah,” said Hermione. “Well, if you want the password, I daresay 
you’ll just crack it.” 

“ ’Course I do,” said Harry, “I don’t care how well we 
know the password, it’s not worth the trouble.” 

“That’s what we’re doing, isn’t it,” said Ron. 
“We’re going to give it to you!” 

“Yes,” said Harry, “yes, I’m going to give it to you, this is 
the lucky guess.” 

“Umbridge?” asked Hermione, sitting up. 

“Well, she’s been asked to come over to the Three 
Broomsticks, and there’s a lot of people in there. I 
thought you’d be able to guess her because you’re
====================
“No,” said Harry, “not if you want to!” 

“Oh, I know,” said Hermione. “I’ve been keeping you away 
from dinner, so I’ll be surprised if you don’t jus’ 
break the rules again!” 

“That wouldn’t be so bad,” said Ron. “And I’m 
sure you’re going to want to refuse to follow in 
his footsteps!” 

“What rules?” shouted Hermione. 

“Well, the ones that are always rules,” said Ron. 
“They’re kept in the same house.” 

“You’re talking about rules?” said Harry, who had 
been concentrating on the last sentence. “Rules.” 

“They’re in the same house as your mum and dad,” said 
Ron. “So they’re in the same house, but the rules 
don’t contradict each other!” 

“Yes, they do,” said Harry. “They both left the house 
when you were seven, and they’re here now. The rules 
don’t contradict each other but they both left the 
house when you were eight. And if they didn’t agree 
with you, you’re in the same house, aren’t you?” 



Page | 683 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Yes,” said Harry, “but they are in the same 
house.” 

“So you can’t have anything to do with it,” said 
Hermione, “or else keep in the same house?” 

“No,” said Harry. 

“I know that’s the theory,” said Hermione. 

“I’ve got to say,” said Ron, “that it’s not the rule, it’
====================
” 

“Oh, don’t start it!” 



Page | 541 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Don’t start it!” 



“I’ve been wanting to ask her, she’s been really 
awful to me this summer!” 

“I thought you were too!” 

“I’ve been really angry with her! You’re so 
sensitive!” 

“I’ve been!” 

“You’re so important to me!” 

“I’ve been!” 

“I’ve been,” she said shrilly. “But she’s not 
secret-Keeper, she’s the one!” 

“Who is she?” 

“Well, it’s a bit hard to say, because we haven’t all got 
the answers yet!” 

“Oh, we’ll try!” Harry said, and he pointed to the 
figure on the floor. 

“Oh, we’ll try,” said Hermione, “because she’s 
really good at hiding things.” 

“And we’ll try even harder if she’s not there!” 

“We’ll try,” said Harry, “because she’s better 
when it comes to things like Durmstrang’s — ” 

“She’s really great at telling lies, isn’t she?” 
said Ron, who looked as though he would rather have 
got to go to the end of the corridor without Hermione 
than to have to make much more difficult, “and 
it’s a bit hard to be honest with her because she’s 
naughty and it’s hard to be brave and she’s stupid and 
she’s brave — ” 

�
====================
” said Harry, and the voices of both Ron and Hermione were echoed around the room. 
“I’m scared,” said Ginny, her eyes on her new 
cage. “I can’t believe it’s happening — ” 

“You haven’t been introduced to Madame Maxime?” 
said Ron. 

“Yeah,” said Ginny, “but she’s always been keeping 
the secret, it’s just that she doesn’t want us to 
know what she’s up to.” 

“Well, I’ve been thinking you’d better tell us your 
thoughts,” said Ron. “Because we’re in for a rude 
teasing at least a year’ early on, you’ve been 
pushed out of our lessons, you’ve been hung around the 
walls, and obviously you’re not going to be able to change 
your name, so we’d better find another one.” 

“Oh,” said Ginny, with a kind of squeaky grin. “Right, 
I’m off to bed,” she added in a singsong voice. 

Harry and Ron were sitting around the long table 
behind the cupboard door, only a few feet from the 
oncoming tide, watching the scene from the window. 

“But I haven’t been disturbed at all, I just don’t 
want to.” 

“Oh, there’s been a couple of reported drownings.” 

“I’m not sure that’s happening,” said Hermione, 
“but we’re getting nearer, we’re approaching Gringotts, 
and we’re not going to be able to leave unless we’ve 
asked to.” 

Page | 723 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Ginny’s not going to be able to,” said Ron. �
====================
“It’s only one call,” said Hermione, and she pulled out a streak of 
greenish smoke and started to smoke it again. 

“Mad-Eye was just a bad memory.” 

“Well,” said Harry, “I’m sorry, but do you 
think we’d all like to know where he went when he 
went to visit Cedric Diggory?” 

“Well, I think we’d all like to know where he went 
when he went to visit Cedric Diggory?” 

“Oh,” said Hermione, “but how come he knew 
Dumbledore was there?” 

“Well, I’ll explain that in a minute,” said Harry, 
pointing to the spot where the sword was pointing at 
him in the fireplace. “Well, that’s a question I’ll 
have to pass,” he said, and he did not need to finish 
the sentence. “Dumbledore was just a bad memory.” 

“Well, well,” said Harry, who felt his face burn with 
anger. “Dumbledore was just a bad memory. I’ve 
never been asked to a job like that before. I was 
just a kid.” 

“You’re not being asked to do ‘Hey, Harry,’ you’re 
just a kid,” said Hermione, sounding relieved. 

“Well, well,” said Harry, “I’m going to pass on that 
something.” 

Page | 842Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Well, well,” said Hermione, looking slightly 
frightened. “Dumbledore was just a bad memory. I’m 
never been asked to a job like that before. I remember 
playing the hero, I remember being so stupid, but 
Dumbledore was somewhere else, right after I’d 
been offered a position at the Ministry.” 

====================
’s now 
been smashed down,” said Mrs. Weasley, as though she 
had not expected them to hear anything. “I 
thought you didn’t want to tell us, did you?” 

“Well, I don’t think anyone’s going to want to,” said 
Harry. 

“You’re perfectly right,” said Mrs. Weasley. “But the 
we don’t know what was so important to Voldemort. 
We’re having the time of our lives here, and we’re 
going to be tortured.” 

“It was his birthday,” said Mrs. Weasley. 

“He’s having a party,” said Harry. 

“No,” said Mrs. Weasley. “It’s not his birthday.” 



Page | 717 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Yes, he is,” said Mrs. Weasley, “but he was so 
happy about it.” 

“Well, I think you’d better do it now,” said Mrs. 
Weasley. “I’m afraid not.” 

“Maybe you ought to go and tell Snape,” said 
Harry. 

“ ’Course I would,” said Mrs. Weasley, looking 
extremely pleased. 

“I’ll go back and tell him,” said Mr. Weasley. 

“I’m afraid I’m going to have to start looking for 
Dumbledore’s body!” said Mrs. Weasley. “He’s 
been talking about it for ages, and I don’t think 
Dumbledore’s dead.” 

“You’ve been dying to hear more, haven’t you?” 
said Harry, looking down at the empty chair he was 
holding. “You’ve been dying to know what’s happening 
at Hogwarts, have you?�
====================
soundproofed her silence.  “So what?” 

“I think we should hear the voice at the door” 

“What do you think it is?” 

“I’ve heard voices,” said the elf, “from the inside of the 
kitchen.” 

“How come Harry can’t see the door?” 

“I’m sorry,” said the elf, “I think there’s something 
about the soundproofing.” 

“So what do you think, Harry?” asked Harry at 
once. “Is it possible?” 

“I think it’s possible,” said the elf. “But it’s not easy to 
remember to close the door. There’s something in 
the kitchen where it never opened before.” 

“You haven’t heard it yet?” said Harry, very skeptically. 
“What do you think it is?” 

“Something in the kitchen?” 

“Something in the kitchen?”

The elf looked hopefully at the floor below. 



“Oh,” said Harry, but he was quite mistaken. 
He was looking around the kitchen. 

There was an enormous sign on the wall: 

Page | 514 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 






UNDERSTANDING FUEL ‘FRAGRY,’ THIS IS A SERIOUS 
SOMETHING. 

“What?” asked the elf, blinking anxiously. 

“What does it mean?” 

“It means the foot of the stairs.” 

“But how do you know that’s the foot of the stairs?” 

“Because we heard voices,” said the elf, 
“from the kitchen.”

====================
” said Hermione, “but the bit about 
hurting his feelings with the bit about his 
mother is a bit odd, because he says he’d 
just been having a bit of a hard time with her 
because she’s such a pushover.” 

“She’s a pushover?” said Ron, “because she can’t 
stand being hugged around your neck.” 



Page | 666 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“I don’t think that’s terribly hygienic,” said 
Hermione. “But if he’s having a bit of a hard time 
with her — ” 

“ ‘horses don’ seem to like being hugged around 
your neck,’ ” said Harry. “Tell me, what’s wrong 
with that bit?” 

“It’s a bit rude,” said Hermione, “but he says he’s 
been having a bit of a hard time with her because 
he’s so fond of her.” 

“I’m starting to think they’re both amazing,” 
said Ron, “and they’re both wearing Gryffindor robes 
that make them jump and cry like she’s doing her 
best to protect them.” 

“Might be a bit more protection,” said Hermione 
satisfiedly. 

“So we’ll be having a bit of a party,” said 
Ron, who looked a little worried. 



“Yeah, but I haven’t got any drinks,” said Hermione 
in a rather muffled voice. “I’ve got to go to the 
dinner with Filch and Bill and Fleur and see whether 
they’re friends, because all these stuffs got to 
be checked before we’re allowed to come.” 

“No,” said Hermione, “no, you’
====================
 

Hermione was staring at the ceiling, her wand raised 
in a kind of singsong voice, with her eyes wide and 
right. 

“Hermione,” said Ron, looking around for the source of 
the noise. 

“Oh, right,” said Hermione, “we’re not supposed to 
have done that.” 

“It’s not right,” said Ron, “you’ll have to go back 
to the library and do it properly, will you?” 

“Oh,” said Hermione, with an air of 
satisfaction. “But you’re supposed to be doing it, 
you’ve got to have some kind of memory.” 

“Right,” said Ron. “But if you’re really good at 
remembering things, that’s another thing.” 

“What do I need to remember?” Hermione demanded. 
“Well, I’ve got to remember what you’d gotten 
out of that cup.” 

“Yeah, well,” said Ron, smiling at her, “it’s not 
for nothing, is it?” 

“Yeah, well, what’s the point?” asked Hermione. 

“You’d be really lucky if you’d got us everything we 
deserved,” said Ron, “pretty good at anything except 
remembering details of what happened if you’ve 
got the memory.” 

“I haven’t got the memory,” said Hermione, “and I 
haven’t got the wand.” 

“Oh, come off it,” said Ron, looking impressed. “You 
always seem to have some talent for inventing things, 

and I’m sure you’d be better suited to learning how to 
remember these lessons by owl than by paper, which 
you’d need some help with. And you’d better have 
====================
“I don’t know why he says that,” said Harry, 
looking up. “I’ve never seen anyone wear 
them.” 

“Are you wearing them?” 

“Yes,” said Harry, looking down. “My dad’s wearing them. 
You’re tied to their neck.” 

“Yes, I am,” said Harry, “but I’ll make sure your father 
doesn’t get it.” 

“You’re a boy,” said Hermione, and she turned 
away again, smiling at him. 

“Well, I’m getting used to it,” said Harry, “I’m not 
getting used to it, I just think it’s better than being a 
boy.” 

“Yeah, well,” said Hermione, “but it’s just not 
true.” 

“You’re not a boy,” said Harry. “You’re a girl.” 

“Yeah, I’m starting to,” said Hermione. 

“Well, you can’t be a girl,” said Harry, “because there 
are only two boys and a girl. So you’re a boy.” 

Page | 993Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“But you’re not a boy!” said Hermione. 



“Well, I’ve told you, even if you are a boy, you are still 
born.” 

“But as I’ve said, there are only two boys.” 

“And you’ve got to be seventeen.” 

“Yeah,” said Hermione, “and we’ve got to be seventeen. 
We’ve got to have our parents’ names, too.” 

“But you’re not a boy!” 

====================
"What would happen if a lot of the students get expelled?" said McGonagall impatiently.
  Harry thought he saw a light in the distance, but the distant sound of a distant drawling animal made him stop right in front of him.  He opened his mouth. 
"Nothing," said Professor McGonagall.
Harry looked up.  Professor McGonagall was pointing at a small stuffed frog, which was still whimpering in the distance.
"I'm sure any student who's got any questions about
Hogwarts will be very grateful Professor Snape told me what they're going to have to
do in the coming weeks," she said, trying to pull herself together again.  "So, dear," she said, and she and Professor
Snape came to an abrupt halt in front of the Hufflepuff table.  Quidditch practice was to be held at
the end of next week.  Harry sat down with Professor McGonagall.  She was staring into the
television, and with her wide, dark eyes she appeared to be having
a child.  She was holding a small, purple, and gold ring.  She was staring
at Harry, who looked back at her, and gave him a very small smile.

"You will get into the team's colors," said Professor McGonagall
in a strained, yet sympathetic voice. "I would also like to ask you
what you're going to do in the coming weeks, dear."

Harry knew what she was thinking. He had been to Divination, and
he had thought about the Triwizard Tournament, about the Phoenix
Rookwood.  He had thought about the Tournament, and the idea that he
could be the champion.  He had thought about the Triwizard
Championship, and the idea that he could be the champion
now that he had the Gryffindor champion. . . .  He did not know what to
think anymore. 

When he spoke, his voice was cold and cold. 

"But I have to tell you something. . . . Mr. Ollivander, I am
sure many of you will find it exciting," he said. "The occasion is
now, and you will be chosen for your efforts."

He smiled. 



Harry looked at Hermione. 

"Professor
====================
“I know it’s not easy,” said Ron, “but it’s harder than you’d like.” 

“You’re not a wizard, are you?” asked Harry. “You’re 
born in the wizarding world.” 

“Exactly!” said Ron. “You’re a prefect, and the Ministry 
forces understand that.” 

“Well, I think I’m going to be expelled for trying to 
start a witch group,” said Harry. 

“What group?” said Ron, looking puzzled. 

“I’m going to be expelled for trying to start a 
witch group,” said Harry. 



Page | 551 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“I’m surprised we’re not talking about Gryffindor,” said 
Hermione, “or the Ravenclaw or whatever they’re 
now.” 

“Well, I’ll be expelled,” said Harry, “because I’ve 
come under Ministry eye-poison.” 

“Well, well, well,” said Ron. 

“You’re under Ministry eye-poison,” said Harry 
consistently. “We’ve got to find out what ’re going 
to do next.” 

“What?” 

“Well,” said Ron, “when we’ve found out what 
Horcruxes and Beaters are.” 

“But they’re not the only ones,” said Hermione, 
“the whole thing’s been put on hold, because it’s 
difficult to keep track of all your 
Charms, and we don’t know how many 
Concealed Stands they've been put in, so we’ve 
had to keep a lookout for them all. So we’ve 
let go of
====================
“Oh,” said Luna, with an air of 
indignation. “Oh, Harry has always been a bit 
careful about your egg.” 

“Oh,” said Harry at once, looking out of the window. 

“Well, if you’re going to be tying it this year, you 
have to be careful. ...” 

Page | 735Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“So we’re going to have to be extra careful, Harry, 
because there’s a bit of a problem with the dragon 
that’s got to be tied to the collar before it can be 
cut off. ...” 

“Yeah,” said Harry. “Yeah, well, the only way we’ll be 
getting rid of that dragon is if we’ve got a nice good 
guard around the other one.” 

“Yeah,” said Luna, as though this was a good answer 
too, as though it did not really matter. 

“Well, you’d better get up to the problem now,” said 
Harry. 

“Right then,” said Luna, gesturing up at the dragon 
that was not tied to the collar. “Okay, everyone 
now, I’ve got a question for you — was there a 
sword in the cupboard under the sink?” 

“Yeah,” said Harry, shocked and horrified. 

“I mean, there’s a lot of stuff under that cupboard, but 
none of it’s real. The thing’s in the library, and you 
know what it says?” 

“Yeah,” said Luna, “it’s in the library, and I saw 
that one, I saw it in Transfiguration. And people 
know about it.” 

“What?” said Harry. 

“Well, it’s a bit like the sword in that book. It’s a set
====================
“But what do you reckon he’s got?” 



Page | 538 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“I’d say he’s a bit of a prat,” said Hermione, 
looking up at Ron. “You’ve got to admit that’s a bit of 
a relief.” 

“Well, if he’s a bit of a prat then I’m afraid we’ll have 
to wait our turn,” said Ron. 

“Er — ” said Hermione, but she looked rather 
impressed. “But we’ve got to wait until next Saturday, 

anyway.” 

“We’re going to have to wait until Saturday!” said 
Ron, as Hermione retreated into the corner where 
she had sat, still wearing her Invisibility Cloak. 

“Well — summat,” said Hermione. 

“Who cares?” said Ron, lowering his voice to a whisper. 
“We’re not going to be able to check on everything.” 

“We’re up on the seventh floor,” said Hermione, 
“we’re riding the rat,” she added, pointing at the 
statue of Uncle Vernon, which was now flying in 
and out of the window as they passed. 

“So — so you’ve got to go down to the feast,” said 
Hermione. 

“Oh yeah,” said Ron, “because the feast’s going to be 
Monday morning and I’ve got to be really careful.” 

“I haven’t got to be really careful?” said Hermione. 
“You’ll be really worried about something if you don’t 
get there early.” 

“I’ll be really careful,” said Ron. “I’ve got to be really careful.” 

He was still pointing at the

’s a bit of a laugh,” said Ginny. 

“Did you know that 

Page | 159 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




we’ve been meeting lately?” asked Ginny. 

“Oh, yeah,” said Harry, “we met at the 
International Astronomy Cup.” 

“That’s what’s great about it,” said Ginny. 
“You get to meet people, you get to be in the 
crowd, and it’s really friendly.” 

“It’s not great,” said Harry, “but that’s what 
makes you so special.” 

Ginny stared at him for a moment, then said, “I 
plan on chivvying up the Gryffindor table,” and 
she gave one more vicious look at Ginny, who shrugged 
off the question. 

“Well, I’ll do it,” said Harry. “Ginny’ll be happy.” 

“I’ll be happy!” said Ginny. 

“I’ll be great,” said Harry, grinning, “and I’ll be 
responsible for the Slytherin table.” 

Ginny laughed again and Harry saw that she also 
was smiling. Ginny gave another nasty look at 
Harry, then opened her mouth to retort, “Er — 
the point is, if we’re going to have a meeting this 
important, we ought to be able to decide — ” 

“ ‘the date of the meeting,’ ” said Harry. 

“But why’s the meeting so important?” Ginny 
smiled. “Because you’re the one who gets 
rolled up, thinks that’s what you’re all about.” 

“Well, okay, okay,” said Ginny. “Well, if that’s what 
we want, we ought to

” said Snape, “the person who is the most dangerous 
subject on earth, Potter,” 

“He is,” said Snape, “the weapon of choice for many 
wizards of the Dark Arts, Potter. ...” 

“He is?” said Harry. 



Page | 826 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“He is,” said Snape, “in the form of an animal. 
“And he is a beast, and a creature which, for centuries, 
has been consumed by the lure of flesh and blood. 
The lure of flesh and blood, which is death. ...” 

He let out a harsh sneeze. 

“The lure of flesh and blood, which is death. ...” 

“Does it work, then?” asked Harry. 

“Yes,” said Snape. 

“But it is Death’s lure that you are using. There is no 
need to use it to escape. ...” 

“But it is Death’s lure that you are using,” said 
Snape, “that you are making Potter’s escape happen. 
You have been using him for centuries. ...” 

“The lure of flesh and blood, which is death,” said 
Snape. 

“The lure of flesh and blood, which is death,” said 
Snape, “that you are making it happen?” 

“Yes,” said Harry, “but it is Death’s lure, not yours. ... 
You are making it happen while he is dead. ...” 

“I — I am,” said Snape, “making it happen while he 
is dead. ...” 

“But Death does not make me make him kill you,” 
said Harry. 

“That is no argument,” said Snape. “You have been 
making him die for you. You have been trying to 
force him to
====================
"Oh yes," said Professor McGonagall, but Harry was staring at her too.  "You have been denied entrance into the Hall of Prophecy.  I see -"
"I thought you - like -"
"You have told Professor McGonagall I want you back in the library," said Professor McGonagall, looking suddenly nervous.  "You have told her you think you can help me.  I will be joining you in the library when you have returned.  I know that you will need to come and fetch us, but I think you will find that I am rather quick for students."
Professor McGonagall did not seem to be expecting Harry's greetings; he just looked as though he had received them eagerly.  Professor McGonagall merely stared at him.  Professor McGonagall continued to stare at Harry.  Harry could tell that she was quite enjoying the way he looked at her.  She continued to stare at him, and he felt it was a good thing.  Professor McGonagall seemed to be enjoying the fact that he was back in the library.
Harry had already returned downstairs and found Professor McGonagall sitting down on top of the long pile of books.  She took out a book of Galleoloids and Arithmancy, a book of Wizarding Quidditch tactics, and a quill of short, sharp words.  She looked up "Wizarding Quidditch Teams"; she looked up "Wings of Destiny"; she looked up "Wizarding Understanding"; she looked up "Wizarding Traditions"; she looked up "Ogwarts Wandering"; and finally, she looked up "Ogwarts-Wand-Taking."
"I wish I could say that I enjoyed telling you this," said Professor McGonagall, nodding at Harry, "but I thought you might have a better idea of what I mean by my term."
"Professor, I've already said that I thought you enjoyed telling me this," said Professor McGonagall, looking down at Harry, who had a start on the parchment.  "I thought you might have noticed that I've already given you further information on the wizarding world, and you seem to be much less interested in my explanations of wizard's rights and practices than in my explanations of the reasons why some people have no right to land land on public land.  I hope you'll give me another chance
====================
” said Ron, with a drawing under his voice. “I’ve been looking for it.” 

“It’s in the library,” said Hermione, looking around. 
“The library’s in the Department of Mysteries. Professor 
Black has been looking for it for four years. It’s in the 
Department of Mysteries. I’ve never seen anything like it.” 

“But why?” said Harry, moving closer to her. 

“Because you’ve been looking for it for four years,” said 
Hermione. “Why? Because the one bit of Sirius I 
knew about is locked in the locket, and all it’s ever been 
staggered out of is in the Department of Mysteries.” 

“Sirius’s locked in the locket,” said Ron, his eyes on Grawp 
as though he was hoping to catch Ron dirty-smelling a 
flaw. “It’s the only place he’s ever been: Catch him, 
you know, they’re bound to catch him.” 

Grawp was on his feet, his gaunted face gleaming 
against the beaded cuff of his long, pointed blackened 
snout. 

“I think we ought to talk about this,” said Hermione 
earnestly. “Grawp’s always been really keen to have 
him in his little corner, he’s always been trying to find out 
how to get around the Department of Mysteries, to see 
him — ” 

“I’m not sure I’m going to be able to do that,” said 
Grawp. “He’s been having difficulties getting on with 
it all, not least because I’m afraid of what he’s going 
to do.” 

“He’s having trouble getting on with it all too, you 
know, Dumbledore’s blocking everything,” said Hermione 
anxiously. “You’
====================
I thought,” said Harry, “that’s what I’ve been trying to ask.” 



Page | 947Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“But your parents haven’t been telling you,” said 
Hermione, her eyes narrowed and her hands still 
sitting. “They haven’t seen you on anything like 
anyone’s been telling them.” 

“Yeah,” said Harry. “I’ve been trying to talk to 
your parents, and I think they’ve all just 
said they’d be mad if they knew you’d go.” 

“Yeah, that’s what they’re saying,” said Harry, 
thinking hard. 

“I’ll see you for Christmas, Harry,” said Hermione 



“Yeah, I’ll see you,” said Harry. 

“But what’s going to happen to you, Hermione?” 

“Well, it’s going to be really hard to leave the house 
without your parents’ permission. 

“Well, come on,” he said to Ron, but Ron did not 
seem keen to believe him. “You’re going to 
have to tell them what you’re going to do tonight, 
as they’re already warning us.” 

“Right,” said Ron. 

He glared at Harry. 

“You’re going to tell them what we’re going to do tonight, 
as they’re already warning us.” 

“What do they want?” asked Harry. 



Page | 948Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“They want to know what’s going on inside the house, 
because they think we’re going to break out anyway, 
of course!” 

“Come off it,” said Ron.
====================
’s a bit odd,” said Harry. 

“Well, you’re already a bit of a prat, aren’t you, 
Dobby?” said Fred, looking slightly affronted. 
“You’re not really a prat, are you?” 

“I’m not really a prat, I’m just a sixteen-year-old.” 
said George, getting to his feet. “Just trying to 
keep a tight hold on your elder sister.” 

“Yeah, well, she’s got a real knack for hiding things from 
themselves.” 

“And do you know what makes you a prat?” 

“No,” said George, “no, I’ve come to ask.” 

“You’ve got a very special mother,” said Fred, 
clutching George’s shoulder. “She’s been using 
me as a shield for most of my life, because 
I’ve been in contact with her through her husband, 
Harry. Anyway, you’re in my debt. I’ve got to 
keep a close eye on you, though.” 

“I’ve got to keep a close eye on my sister too,” said 
Fred. 

“Yeah, well, if we spend too much time together, I’ll be 
looking for the Father’s Horcrux.” 

Page | 1037Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“You’re not going to be able to find it.” 



Harry sighed deeply. 

“Well, if she’s gone to see her mother again, I’ve 
good news.” 

He pulled out his wand, which was still pointing 
unusually fast ahead, and withdrew it. 

“Knows. Only they’d do it. So what’s the plan, 
Harry?” 
====================
“Why’s 
Sirius gone?” 

“There’s something wrong with Sirius,” said Ron 
very quietly, as they moved across the room to the 
table where Hermione sat, “and I’ve had to go and get 
Draco’s memory, because Sirius — ” 

“Yeah,” said Hermione. “He’s got some new information I 
can’t get — ” 

“I’m going to stay here,” said Ron. “I’ve got to be careful.” 

“I’m not going to be in the tent,” said Hermione 
smoothly. “I heard Sirius was going to come and get 
him...” 

“His father’s not going to be back,” said Ron flatly. 
“We’ve told him we’re going to stay here and see if he’s 
gone to get Sirius — ” 

“No,” said Hermione, “he’s going to tell Sirius we’re not 
going to let him get Sirius, we’ve got to let him find out 
how he’s going to behave, and if he doesn’t we’re not going 
to ask him if he’s going to tell us.” 

“Well, if he’s going to tell us,” said Ron, “why not let him 
see if he’s happy?” 

“Well, if he’s happy,” said Hermione, “and happy, 
Sirius, then why not just leave him here?” 

“I’ll stay here,” said Harry, and they set off for the 
entrance hall. 

“Do you think they’re going to write to the Ministry of 
Magic about this?” asked Ron, hurrying over to the 
door into the hall. 



Page | 476 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.
====================
“That’s right!” 

And she was soaring down into the bowels of 
her cabin. 

“Sorry,” said Ron, who was now looking 
uncomfortably worried. “We’d better get going. I 
should’ve known, you’d only just helped me 
see my mum when she was ill.” 

“But you’d have been a lifesaver,” said 
Hermione. 

“I’ve never been so happy,” said Ron. 

“You’ve been very kind,” said Harry, rubbing his 
head and feeling a little sick. “You’ve been 
the kindest person I’ve ever met — ” 

“Oh I’m sorry,” said Hermione. “I had to be.” 

“I’ve been the kindest, most kindest person you’ve ever 
known.” 

“Oh,” said Hermione. “Well, of course, you’ve 
all got to feel sorry for yourself, and if you ever 
got the chance to say thank you, you’ll be a kinder 
than I ever could be.” 

“Well, of course, you’ll do it,” said Harry, feeling 
a little disgruntled. “The whole thing has been” — he 
pulled a bag of sweets from inside his jacket — 
“a little lonely.” 

“Yeah,” said Ron, tipping the sweets into his 
pocket, “but the last bit of happiness was 
not when I’d got the chance to say thank you.” 

“I’d like to thank you for everything,” said 
Hermione, folding up her bag. “But I can’t ... I 
don’t know how I’d feel.” 

“You’re not the only one,” said Ron, “and that’s not 
rid
====================
“I can’t believe it’s not 
Hogwarts for me!” 

“I’m sorry,” said Angelina. 

“You’re not being honest with me,” said Ron. 
“If Dumbledore wanted you to be here, he 
would’ve known what to do if he saw you 
over the weekend.” 

“He knew what to do?” said Hermione. 

“He was Headmaster of Potions this year,” said 
Ron. 

“I’ve got a feeling you’d want to go home, too!” 
said Angelina. 

“Of course I’d want to be back in my dormitory — ” 

“I’ve been hiding!” said Ron, sniggering. “I’ve only 
been out of the room once!” 

“Not this time!” said Hermione, looking shocked. “I 
thought Dumbledore was really sorry that you’re here, 
but I thought he was right to hand you back!” 

“So did I!” said Angelina. “I’m so sorry — ” 

“He wanted you to take it back to the dormitory and 
get some sleep!” 

“And so did I!” said Hermione, tears still leaking 
slightly from under her eyes. 

“Well, he did wish you well, Romilda,” said 
Ron, “and he’s been really understanding lately, and 
I think we’ve got a chance to see him full-grown in a 
way.” 

“Yeah,” said Angelina, looking up at Ron, who was 
looking quite positively seething. “He never talks 
about all his family in that kind of conversation.” 

“He’s not as old as you!” said Ron in protest. 

“I’ll bet you’ve seen him,
====================
Harry looked around. Ron was looking back at him with an expression of utter revulsion on his face.
"What?" said Harry.
"You were right," said Ron. "It's okay, you just can't do it again, we've got to get you some food."
"But that's money you've got to pay us, isn't it?"  said Harry.
"Yeah," said Ron. "But if you're going to get any money from us, we're going to know it's gold, aren't we?"
"I doubt it," said Hermione, looking scared.  "If someone bought gold from you, you'd have to answer to them."
"We're not going to tell them they've got to pay us," said Ron, looking rather disappointed.
"That's what they're going to want," said Hermione, frowning.  "They're going to want to know that you're getting food from them."
"What are we going to say?"  said Ron, frowning again. "We're going to ask them to tell us all about the gold they bought us."
"Oh, honestly, if they want to know about it, well, they're going to have to," said Hermione, who was looking very concerned.
Ron looked at Hermione nervously.
"What are you going to tell them?"  he said.  "We're going to ask them to tell us about the gold they bought us."
"What?" said Hermione, looking thoroughly alarmed.  "What are you going to tell them?"
"We want to know about the gold they bought us."
"I can tell them about the gold-"
"Well, we're starting to think it's no good, and it's not worth it," said Hermione, looking worried.  "We've got to tell them. . ."
"I thought you'd ask them about gold," said Ron, with a rather less serious expression than usual, "but we don't want them to know that you've got gold in your pocket?"
"Yeah, we're starting to think that it's rubbish," said Hermione, looking more alarmed than she'd been in the whole wizarding world before.  "We've got to tell them. . . ."
"You've got gold in your pocket?" said Ron, looking less than impressed.
"Yeah, we're starting to think that
====================
” 

“I thought you’d already know it is a joke,” 
said Hermione genially. 

“Well, I’m surprised you haven’t been able to get 
out a bit more,” said Fred. “I can’t believe that 
Weasleys’ punishments aren’t applied to ‘butters and 
cheezhaws, you know, you’re a good boy and 
you’re just so unbelievable.” 

“Fred,” said Hermione, “you just don’t get it. 

We’ve argued about that in class, you know, and 
you know we’re sorry to hear that sort of story, but 
it’s not funny — ” 

“We’ve argued about this in our classes, you know,” 
said Fred. “And we thought it was a clever bit of 
jerk humor to tell someone that you’d banned 
controversial wizards from Hogwarts in the wake 
of the Dungbombs, and we thought it was an excellent 
idea to get rid of them.” 

“Oh, of course it’s not funny,” said Hermione. “Hermione, 
we’ve talked about the subject, you know what we’re 
going to try and do.” 

“Yeah,” said Fred, “we’ve got to keep the subject of 
controversial wizards under our banner.” 

“But you’ve always thought we’d have to leave it up to the 
Dungbombs!” said Hermione. 

“Well, it’s just the Dungbombs’s got a lot to be ashamed of 
one,” said Fred, “and the Wizarding community’s had a 
large chunk of its hopes and dreams fulfilled in the 
last few years.” 

“Yeah,” said Hermione, “but you’re not going to be 
being ashamed to admit that we
====================
’s the worst thing I’ve ever heard. ’Nagini!” 

She looked up at Dean, who looked as pale as he 
had been when he had spoken, and then she said, “Erm, 
we’re starting to understand 
what ’im ‘e’s got to do.’ What’s the problem?” 

“I don’t know,” said Ron, the moment Hermione 
had entered the room. “Hermione, we’re not 
going to be able to find the sword.” 

“But — ” 

“Maybe she’s right,” said Hermione, looking slightly 
shocked. 

“Maybe she’s wrong,” said Ron, looking quite keen to 
interview her. “You know what I think? We’re 
going to be lucky if we get her outta here before 
the sword’s found, and we’ll be able to find it later — ” 



Page | 536 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“What?” 



“It’s — it’s been put there,” said Ron, “but I don’t think 
we’re going to need it.” 

“It’s not going to be a problem?” 

“Oh yes,” said Hermione. “I mean, we’ve just got to 
keep in touch, keep in touch.” 

Ron looked around at her. 

“Well, I’m sure we’ll find the sword in a bit of 
time,” he said, “but we’ll need the sword before 
the sword’s found.” 

“It’s a bit of a gamble,” said Hermione, “but it’s 
sure a good bet.” 

“I think it’s worth it,” said Ron
====================
“Sir,” said Hermione, “you’re not supposed to be in the Room of Requirement.” 
“Why?” 

“Because I can’t stop myself saying it,” said 
Ron, who was staring at a small egg sitting in the 
middle of his chair. 

“Nothing I can do,” said Harry under his breath. 
“I’ll do it, and then you’ll know. ...” 

“You’ll know,” said Hermione 
impatiently, “because you’re supposed to be in the 
Room of Requirement.” 

“Yeah,” said Ron, smiling. 

“We can’t change the Room of Requirement anymore, 

because that’s been done before.” 

“There’s been a real attempt to do it,” said Harry, 
jumping up to the table to help Ron with the egg. 
“They killed a lot of people, though, so it’s just a 
few of those,” he said, pushing the egg aside and 
holding it up in front of Hermione. “For a start, 
there’s a new secretary here.” 

“You’re in charge,” said Harry. “I’d be in charge of 
people who want to come.” 

Ron gave a little pause, then muttered something 
like “Yeh’ll be in charge, too,” and Harry 
moved out of the way. 

“Sir,” said Hermione. “I don’t want you to come 



“Oh,” said Ron, patting the egg again. “Well ...” 

They both looked up. Hermione was looking 
around the room again, and as she did so she 
greeted Harry and Ron together. 

“So,” Harry said, breathing deeply and holding up a 
hand to show his hand, “you’re still
====================
“With a bit of extra effort,” she said, “I could have 
done with a few more Quidditch practices.” 

“What about you, Professor?” said Ron, his eyes 
screwed up against the heavy weight of the book 
in his hands. “You still haven’t got your essay?” 

“Yes,” said Professor Umbridge, and she crept back 
to her desk, Ron by her side, and Harry by his 
side. “Professor, this is a problem for you and Professor 
Umbridge. We need to find a meeting place.” 

“Professor, if you’re going to be here, why not come and help 
me?” said Harry, but he had already put a hand on 
Umbridge’s shoulder to stop him from hitting her. 
“Professor, that’s the first time Umbridge’s been attacked,” 
said Umbridge in a voice he recognized at once. 
“And you’re supposed to be reading this, are you?” 

“Yes,” said Harry. 

“I’m sorry,” she said, “but I’m sure we could come. I 
know you’ve got a meeting place, but I’m afraid 
we’d miss out on a great opportunity to practice with 
Professors Filch and Sprout.” 



Page | 691 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“I’ll come too,” said Harry, “but I’m sure you’re up to a 
proper practice session.” 

“Yes,” said Umbridge, “yes, I’ve heard that you 
have a favorite place, the Quidditch field.” 

“And what about the lake, Professor?” asked Harry 
and Ron together, looking alarmed. 

“Well, I’ve found my spot,” said Umbridge, and she 
turned to Harry
====================
Gryffindor had emerged from the fire, 
crestfallen, pale and bleeding, and stood before 
the great mound of gold and silver,

his head bobbing up and down like a grotesque 
figure of Christmas bauble, but still somehow 
unwilling to be cheated. 

“What’s going on?” 

“Well,” said Harry, gazing at the place where the 
gold and silver lay upon the long silver shafts. “You 
know what it’s like for people like me.” 

“Yeah,” said Ron. “Long queues. The Death Eaters are 
still waiting for people to show up. I’ve never been 
able to get in before.” 

“ ‘Nightmare on the Underground’?” 

“Yeah, they’re all going to wake up this morning with 
their toes on the ground.” 

“The conductor’s going to get there in one 
hundred seconds anyway.” 

“Hang on, we’ve got two minutes left, we’re about 
to go down the ladder.” 

“Oh — I’ve got a feeling we’ll need to hurry.” 

“I’ll put my wand down, I’m not going to 
understand.” 

“That’s your wand,” said Hermione, “and not yours, 
but mine.” 

“Oh, we’re going to Hogwarts, we’re going to 
Hogwarts.” 

“I’ll go back,” said Ron, “and if you’re not going 
to help me, it’s not worth it.” 

“Oh,” said Hermione, “but that’s where we’re 
going, we’re not going to be able to penetrate the
====================
“Oh, look,” said 
Hermione, and she looked up at the dark ceiling, 
“you’d expect to find something like a balustrade on 
a boggart, would you?” 

“Yep,” said Harry, and he pulled the balustrade around 
the ceiling, tugging it out of its hiding place. He 
pulled out a map, and he hurried to the door. 
“We’ve got a bit of an exhibition for you.” 

“It’s not that big,” said Ron, as the map burst open 
and Harry saw Ron and Hermione, still staring 
out of the window. “We’re only using the first one. 
The one with the Snatchers.” 

“Yeah,” said Harry. 

He pulled out his wand and tapped it upon the 
map, which began to read: 

WE ARE 

THE

THE 

THE 

THE 

THE 

TEENAGE 

OF 

THE STUDY 

THE 

TEENAGE 

OF THE 

TEENAGE 

OF THE 

TEENAGE 



Harry did not know how he had managed to 
contact Hermione and Ron, who were still staring 
out of the window. Though all the class had halted 
to take a look at the map, Harry remained, looking 
up at the ceiling, his heart leaping as he 
did so. 

“So,” he said in a hoarse voice, “I thought we’d put out 
some sort of notice about the library?” 

“Oh,” said Hermione, “oh yes. We are supposed to be 
taking lessons in the evenings.” 

“We’ve got a problem,” said Harry, sitting down 
and staring through the bars of the spiral staircase. 
“You’re supposed to be up in the common room, 
and the girls are always asleep.” 

“Oh, yeah
====================
“You’re here to save the day,” said Harry, and he left the room. He had been staring down at the 
stag in his hair, immersed in an odd, eerily painful 
spot. 

Page | 495 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Are you mad?” said Ron, looking from Mr. 
Weasley to Harry to await his turn. “And you — ” 

“Have you ever shown any remorse?” asked 
Ron. 

“No,” said Harry. “Mr. Weasley told me to stop showing 
that sort of affection toward anyone,” he added, 
“so I thought it’d better just be me, Ron.” 

“Don’t you realize?” said Ron, looking from Ron to 
Harry to the hole in the wall behind them, “Mr. Weasley 
saved me! I’m still saving Ginny!” 

“You’re mad,” said Harry, “and that’s true.” 

“Mr. Weasley told me it’s all in my head,” said 
Ron, “but — ” 

“That’s not true!” said Harry, “Mr. Weasley told you 
everything was fine, didn’t you just go and get 
Ginny?” 

“Mr. Weasley told me I’d get back in his office — ” 

“Mr. Weasley told you I’d have lunch with him,” 
said Harry, “and I got you an owl from his girlfriend. I 
see.” 

“Oh,” said Ron, looking slightly alarmed. “Well, I’ll 
be able to give you another one.” 

“I’ll,” Harry repeated, and he led the way out of the 
door, Ron followed the others in silence, and Harry 
sprinted back into the hall, accompanied by Hermione, 
who was now

they were in the wrong place,

there were no 
magical damage, they’d miss the 
point, so they were left as a guessing game 
around them, and I’d go back.” 

“That’s how it is,” said Fred, making a small 
shudder of the idea that they might have missed 
the point. “You’re looking at them in that 
wrong place, Harry, remember?” 

“Oh yes, they were in a Ministry building,” said 
Harry. “Dumbledore’s Head of Department.” 

“So they were in a Ministry building,” said Ron, 
looking slightly happier than he usually did when 
he was talking about the Ministry, “in the 
wrong place?” 

“Dumbledore’s head of department,” said 
Harry. 

“That’s right,” said Fred, who had taken a tentative 
look at Mr. Weasley and Bill, who had 
come to join them at the foot of the stairs. “This 
is exactly how it used to be,” he said, as Fred 
lowered his voice to a whisper. “You’ve got to keep 
checking your memory, remember, because those 
Page | 768 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




those things that happened at the wrong time — ” 

“Oh yes,” said Mr. Weasley, “I’m sorry I said 
Dumbledore was in charge, but it’s the same old, 
same old,” he added hastily, twisting his 
very long nose in his hand. “Yes, of course, there are 
different kinds of memories, of course, but in 
this case, Dumbledore was the Headmaster.” 

“What did you say?” said Ron, looking horrified at 
the look
====================
“Why does everyone talk about him?” 

“Because when Malfoy comes of age he’s 
expected to win,” said Harry. “To win big.” 

“He’s going to show us what you’re like when 
you can’t defend yourself, and he’s going to show us 
what you’re strong for.” 

“You’re not weak!” 

“We’ve got to defend ourselves!” 

“We’re supposed to be strong!” 

“You’re not going to be weak!” said Harry, who 
now looked up at Hermione. “We’re supposed to be 
strong and fight! We’re supposed to be able to do all 
this stuff because people are watching us! We 
know only too well!” 

“You’re going to be tested, are you?” 

“Yeah,” said Hermione, looking surprised. “There’s 
no way around it, is there?” 

“We’re supposed to be strong and invincible and 
strong for once!” said Harry, his voice cracking. “And 
you’re the champion, aren’t you? Make it happen!” 

Page | 689Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“No,” said Hermione, looking outraged. “I’ve had 
many friends die for us, Harry, and I’ve had many 
friends die for us too.” 

“Yeah, I’ve had friends die for us too,” he said, 
uncomfortable and angry. “But not you, Hermione, 
you’re ready to die for us, you’re ready to do anything — 
anything that’s near us — ” 

“Hermione, I know you’ve got a lot to do and a lot to 
do with bravery! I’ve
====================
” 

“Yeah,” said Harry, and he looked over his shoulder at 
the familiar, pallid shapes that had settled upon 
the hillside. “It’s just that we don’t want to be 
over there. We’ve got to.” 

“Yeah, we’re not exactly sure,” said Hermione. 



Page | 974Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Well, I’ve got to,” said Harry, as he turned back to 
Hermione. “Okay, let’s get out of here, we’ve got to, we can 
— ” 

“Okay,” said Hermione, and she strode out of the 
trees without another word, turned on the spot in the 
grounds, and disappeared again into the darkness. 
Harry thought, for a moment, that Cho’s father 
had set out for the village with his word, and had 
vanished moments before had realized that there was 
no hope. 

“Well, we’ve got to,” he said, “because there’s a prophecy 
around.” 

“Yeah,” said Hermione, “but we’re safer here.” 

They all looked around at her. 

“I mean,” said Harry. 



“Yeah,” said Hermione, “but there won’t be a lot of 
people who can protect themselves.” 

“Okay,” said Harry, and he looked away from her. 
“I mean,” he said, “the only thing we’ve got is the 
prophecy.” 

“Well,” said Hermione, “so we’ll just have to take the 
postponement, won’t we?” 

“Right. Well,” said Harry, nodding his agreement, 
“well, we’ll have to.”

====================
Dumbledore was looking down at Harry, his eyes flickering. 

“I don’t know what you’re talking about, you know, 
or — ” 

“Well — I’m sure it’s nothing to do with — ” 

“What?” said Dumbledore sharply. “But you’re not 
from ‘House of Black — ” 

“I’m sure it’s nothing to do with ‘House of Black!” 
said Dumbledore, now looking away from Harry. 
“But I’m sure you’re of ‘House of Black!” said 
Dumbledore sharply again. “But I’m sure you’ve 
come from ‘Black, Potter,’ ” said Harry. “I’ve been 
there, I’ve seen it, I’ve had your back!” 

“No,” said Harry. 

“Oh no,” said Dumbledore, “you’re just as horrible 
as you’re from — ” 

“Yeah, you’re from ‘House of Black!” said Harry at 
once. 

“I’m sorry,” said Dumbledore coldly. “I’ve been 
warned. I’ve told you, I’ve been under threat — ” 

“Of course you’re from the House of Black!” 

“It’s not the same as ‘House of Black!” 

“Well, I’ll tell you one more thing,” said Dumbledore 
loudly. “You’ve got to admit it’s not as if you’re 
from the House of Black. You’re from the tiny, weird 
house that’s been infiltrated by Dark wizards — ” 

“I’m not trying to be funny!” said Harry, looking 
around at the darkness. “I’m just — ‘Listen to the 
====================
” 

“I’ve always thought that,” said Harry, “this is a great 
present, this is really important, and if you’re 
going to come to these kinds of parties, you’ll come to 
see these people.” 

“Oh, but we’ll be safe,” said Hermione. 

“Okay,” said Harry. “Okay, okay,” he said. “Okay, 
let’s go.” 

The long queues of people all filling up the 
staircase behind them were becoming more and more 
familiar, and it was a good idea to sit down at just 
the two on either side of Malfoy, who had risen 
with a wave of his wand, and Crabbe, whom Harry 
had suspected to have been talking to 
Malfoy, and who seemed to think that he was 
supposed to be pretending to be sorry that he had 
been misunderstood, but who, after all, had 
never spoken to a live Crabbe in his life. 

“I didn’t think that Crabbe was acting kindly,” said 
Malfoy in a low voice. “I heard you talking to 
Malfoy last night.” 

“What?” 

“I heard you talking to Lucius Malfoy.” 

“I think you’re wrong,” said Malfoy, looking 
alarmed. 

“What?” 

“Well, I’ve been listening to what Lucius Malfoy 
said to Albus Dumbledore.” 

“What?” 

“Well, Lucius Malfoy, who has always had a 
disdain for being useful, said that the Dark Lord 
wanted a goblin to lead him into the war.” 

“Let me show you something?” Harry asked. 

“Let me show you something?” said Malfoy, his eyes 
fluttering slightly. “What? You’ve never heard of a 
goblin?” 

“
====================
” said Hermione, “I’m sorry, but I don’t think 
I’m going to be able to fit in to the Hogwarts 
Dangerous-looking list.” 

“Well put,” said Hermione. “I mean, you need to be 
determined to get into the list. Nobody’s got it, 
none of us has ever got into it, not even you, 
Harry.” 

“You’ll be starving yourself to death,” said Ron 
grumpily. 

“If you’re going to be asking for access to a list of 
dangerous people, it’s best you’ve got a good Defense 
Against the Dark Arts teacher.” 

“If he’s teaching,” said Harry. “The thing is, I’m 
planning on asking Professor Snape.” 

“Well,” said Hermione in a low voice, “if he wants to 
try and find out what the Dark Lord is up to, it’s good 
to know you’d rather be with him than with me, 
Hermione.” 

“I’m coming to you,” said Hermione in a hollow voice; 
she was clutching her wand tightly to her chest and 
there was a rustle in her wrist. “As much as I like 
you, Mad-Eye, you need to understand that unless 
you stand up to him — ” 

“If he orders a Death Eater to kill you, then I’m afraid 
that’s what you’ll be fighting. Killing one of us is 
what made the Dark Lord rise. Killing one of us 
is what made You-Know-Who rise.” 

“But I’m going to be fighting him. Why?” 



Page | 734 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Because he’s bound to get us killed,” said Ron, 
who looked slightly bewildered. “
====================
The buzz around the entrance hall had died down. There were no more calls for more action.
The Committee for the Reestablishment of an International Committee for the Control of Magical Illness (CASCILOGUARDO) was emerging from the Great Hall, headed by Professor Slughorn.  His long, aquiver hair had turned to a light gray over its light gray skin.  His pale skin and pale-green eyes were both deep, though they were unfocused.  He was wearing a hooded cloak with no back pockets.  His pale face was set with a mask, and his long fingers were both trembling.  He was holding a knife and fork.  He was bending over the unconscious Professor and offering him a single slice of pie.  He was holding the fork two inches above his right ear.  His face was pale, but it was as pale as he could get without the knife and fork.  He was staring at the other three without a trace of a smile.
Professor Slughorn took off his cloak and began to untie it.  It seemed to be too heavy for him, and she pulled it up over his head.  He had a very strange feeling that she had taken off the cloak.  He looked up and saw that the very bottom of his trousers was ripped and ripped.  He had ripped off the collar of the hat, and now he had a ripped, ripped, ripped feeling in his stomach.  He had been hungry.  He was tired.  He was hungry of food.  He had heard voices somewhere near the school ... and he had felt they were coming from somewhere far away . . . and he thought he knew where the voices were coming from. . . .
And now he saw that the place where they had come was very dark indeed.  He tried to pull off the cloak as quickly as he could, and see what was going on, but his arms and legs were shaking so badly that he didn't have much room to shift his weight.  He sat down on the landing and tried to shift his weight a bit, but his legs were so weak he couldn't do it.  He felt as though his stomach was full of cold, and as he sat staring and thinking, he felt as though he were losing weight.  He hadn't lost a drop of blood since he had come to the hospital wing.
Professor Slughorn took off his cloak
====================
was 
dead. “I told you, he’s back, he’s back, he’s 
dead.” 



Page | 828 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Well, of course he’s back,” said Dumbledore. “Yes, 
you’re going to have to accept that he’s dead,” 

“We’ve got to accept that,” said Dumbledore, and the 
headmaster’s tone of voice 
echoed: “That’s another question, Harry.” 

“Yes,” said Harry, “but we’ve got to accept that he’s 
dead too, because the Death Eaters know he’s gone. 
They’re still searching for him, and they’ve had a 
precautionary tale from the Prophet” (Harry glanced 
at Slughorn, who was staring at him haughtily), “even 
if the Death Eaters catch up, they’ll be in for it. 
You’ll be going to Azkaban and they’ll be glad of it.” 

“Oh,” said Harry, nodding at the ground, and his 
headmaster moved into view behind the headmaster’s 
glance. “Hagrid.” 

“Hagrid,” said Harry. 

“I’m sorry,” said Hagrid in his most casual voice. 

“I’m sorry,” said Harry. 

“But,” said Hagrid, but he did not speak. 

“Hagrid, I’ve just noticed a little something, I was 
thinking it was a bit of a curse. Didn’t make any sense to 
me, but I thought it fit and it shouldn’t have 
happened.” 

“Hagrid, I’ve just noticed a little bit of a curse. There 
isn’t
====================
“Ginny says she’s got a — ” 

“Come off it,” said Ginny. “It was a really good lesson. 
She’s really good.” 

“Well,” said Neville, “I mean, of course we’ve all got to 
go to classes, but also a weekend trip to the zoo. 
I’ve got to go to the hospital wing.” 

“Undoubtedly,” said Professor Umbridge, “you’re 
going to have to stay on vacation for two weeks, 
and then — and then we’ll be on the Hogwarts Express. 
We’ll be able to get all the Hogwarts Express tickets 
from London, and then — ” 

“We’re off to the hospital wing,” said Professor 
Umbridge. 

“Oh,” said Neville, because Professor Umbridge 
was looking up Professor Quirrell’s name in the 
notes attached to every new Sorting Hat she had hooked. 

“Professor Quirrell?” said Professor Umbridge, 
looking up his own name. “You’re Professor Quirrell?” 

“Yes,” said Neville, “but I’m afraid I don’t think you 
can fit on the Sorting Hat.” 

Professor Umbridge turned to him. 

“The Sorting Hat, as you know, is a very ancient and 
influential magical order, and we are finding that it 
seems to have become more flexible over the last few 
years. It is currently sorting all students from Muggle 
colleagues into Defense Against the Dark Arts, and I 
believe that this change will have a profound 
regressive effect upon the wizarding world. I do not 
think that any student wishing to join us should be 
forced to join the Muggle Order.” 

“Of course you’re not!” said Professor Umbridge, 
holding her quill up and frowning slightly. 

“No,�
====================
Harry didn't understand why they were buying a Firebolt.
They were in a very crowded pub.
There was a queue ahead, and people were staring at it.  Harry, who was in no hurry to get into line, thought it best to keep his eyes open.
"What are you all waiting for?" said Ron, looking from one to the other.
"Rita Skeeter," said Harry.  "She's got you waiting for the letter."
"She's waiting!"  said Ron excitedly.  "Why don't we go and get our food, then?"
"Aha!"  Rita Skeeter came hurrying into the bar.
"No thanks," said Harry, giving her a swift wave.  "But don't say I didn't warn you, we've had it tested before."
He'd have been glad to wait to get his letter, but he did, despite the fact that people were staring at the back of the queue, because he knew that he had the letter.  And so they did, and by the time they had reached the front of the queue, they were standing quite apart.  People were staring at the back of the queue, whispering together, wondering what had happened.  Harry didn't know what to think.  He didn't want to talk.
"You stay here, Harry," said Hermione.
"Yeah," said Harry, "I reckon I've got a few other things to do."
"Don't be a prat," said Ron, "you've got to go straight."
"I've got to go straight," said Harry, and he left the pub and walked straight up to the Great Hall.  There was a great silence, and then he heard Hermione saying, "She knows we've been to the Dursleys.  She's the one who went up to them at the Quidditch World Cup."
Hermione, however, didn't seem to like this idea, and Harry still found himself staring at the back of the queue.
"There's a Dursley," he said.  "I was like, 'Oh no, look, they're not here,'" he said, "I've got to go to the Dursleys too."
"Er - yeah, I suppose that's true," said Hermione, "but there's a Dursley.  Could be Harry."
"Er - that
====================
Harry took a deep breath.
"You've got a daughter?"
"Yes," said Professor McGonagall. "Much older than she was when I last examined her, Severus. You see, she is very good-looking, and she is showing signs of intelligence, a good sign, and her eyes are fixed upon the ball of her index finger."
Professor McGonagall smiled a little.
"I will be delighted to see you again, Harry," she said.
"I have great pleasure in welcoming Mr. Severus Snape to this school," said Professor McGonagall. "I have been taking excellent care of him. I particularly like his use of the Imperius Curse, which is very difficult to apply when you have been given the whole of Hogwarts to examine."
"You're the Imperius Curse Professor?"  said Professor McGonagall.
"Yes," said Snape, nodding. "The Imperius Curse is a powerful and deadly curse that can be used to great effect in battle, particularly when the enemy is traveling at a tremendous wave of magic.
"I think that your examinations will help you to gain a great reputation as a Gryffindor Beater," said Professor McGonagall. "Severus Snape has decided to give you an Academy Award Award for his contributions to the world of magic."
Snape winced when Professor McGonagall ignored him.
"His teachers are no longer at all like your colleagues at Hogwarts. They are no longer as noble as you were. They are certainly fewer than before we came of age. You told us so," Professor McGonagall said. "That is why the teachers are not all going to be here tonight. The appointments have already been made, and the teachers will leave for the summer break after the summer term has ended. In the meantime, here is my list of the top 100 Gryffindor Beaters in Britain."
She paused. "Now, there have been four Beaters chosen so far this year. You see, they are the ones who have won the Quidditch Cup this year. These are the Bulgarian and Irish," she said. "They were chosen to represent the country in the last International Cup. We, Harry, have been to three World Cups, and all four of these Beaters have been chosen to represent our country in the next World Cup.
"I would like to start by saying that I am very pleased to be here
====================
“Yeah, I’ve heard it happen too,” said Mr. 
Weasley. “And Harry’s watching anyway.” 

“You’re not in the Order, Mr. Weasley!” said Mr. 
Weasley. “You’re a spy, you’re supposed to be on 
the run!” 

“No, I’m not,” said Mr. Weasley. 

“Mr. Weasley, I don’t think anyone would dare call me 
that,” said Mr. Weasley quietly. “I’d be expelled.” 

“You’re — aren’t you?” said Mr. Weasley, still turning 
his head. “Mr. Weasley, it’s your fault your dad was 
shot down, how did you get on — ?” 

“I’m innocent,” said Mr. Weasley, nodding. “Shall we 
get out of here, then?” 

Page | 434 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“No,” said Mr. Weasley, “we’re supposed to be in the 
Order, Mr. Weasley.” 

“But — ” 

“The Order is a joke, Mr. Weasley. No one’s going to 
let us join them. No, the fact is they’re always 
in there, they’ve got the plan.” 

“But we know what’s going on, Mr. Weasley, it’s 
not happening, it’s not happening!” 

Mr. Weasley looked from Mr. Tonks to Harry, then said 
very quietly, “I’m sure you’d have heard of the 
Ministry of Magic? The Ministry’s — they’ve got all the 
information they need on everybody, they’ve got all the 
information they need on us, Harry.” 

“Oh, that’s right,�
====================
“What?” 

“I don’t think I’ll be able to see all of it,” said 
Hermione. 

“Well, I’ll be able if you want,” said Harry. 

“Well, I’m glad you’re okay,” said Hermione, 
and she led the way out of the entrance hall, as 
continued conversation between them became 
dreadful. 

“I’ll be back in a minute,” said Ron, as they walked 
trembling together along the corridor. “Where 
you’re going, you don’t know where we’re going, do 
you?” 

“Yeah, well, I’m still kind of in the dark about this,” 
said Hermione. “I’ve been looking up routes to 
Hogwarts and I’ve found a couple of secret passages 
into the grounds.” 

“Oh,” said Ron, looking relieved. “Yeah, that’s a 
definitely one of them, I’ve been looking for it for 
months, haven’t I?” 

“Oh,” said Hermione, looking up routes, “yeah, 
right.” 

“If it’s been a secret passageway all along that 
corridor, that’s probably what’s been going on here, isn’t it?” 
said Ron, raising his eyebrows at Hermione. 
“D’you reckon they’re supposed to be hidden in this 
passageway?” 

“Well, yeah,” said Hermione, “not necessarily in the 
right way, I mean, there’s a reason they’re there. I 
could see a couple of things happening, like a gap or 
something.” 

“And what do you mean by a gap?” asked Ron, 
looking inquiringly at Hermione. 

“Well, there’
====================
“I’m sorry,” said Harry, very loudly, “but I — ” 

But the door was locked. 

“I’ll come,” said Lupin, with a slight "oo-oo” 



Page | 339 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“I’ll come,” said Harry, but he flopped back down on 
the bed and looked around. Snape was sneaking 
up the stairs. 

“What?” 

Harry looked around. Snape was already sitting on the 
bottom of the stairs. 

“D’you want to come with me, Potter?” 

“No,” said Harry, “I don’t want to.” 

“We’re supposed to be having a nap,” said Lupin, 
“that’s the law.” 

Harry looked around at Snape again. 

“What?” 

“You’re supposed to come with me, Potter?” 

“No,” said Harry, “we’re supposed to come with you.” 

“You’re taking orders from Snape,” said Lupin, 
“and you’re not supposed to tell us what’s happening 
anymore — ” 

“I — ” 

“ — ’Course we’ll come anyway,” said Lupin, and he 
hissed again, so that Harry had to keep staring at the 
bar at the end of the room. “I’m sure you’ll know 
better than to let us ask questions, Potter.” 

Harry did not like this attitude. He was afraid it would 
backfire. It was not as though he had wanted to ask 
more questions. 

“If you want to come with us,” said Lupin, and he 
stared at the door for a moment, “we’re forbidden to ask 
any
====================
Harry interrupted her as they came out of the bathroom. 

"What?" she said.

"All right, all right," said Harry, turning to watch her, 
his heart beating fast and again... 

She looked worried, as though she had just noticed a 
mist behind her expression. 

"Sorry about that," Harry muttered awkwardly. 

"Oh, hang on," she said, "I was just thinking about the 
Dungeon. I don't know what it is."

"Oh, hang on, you've got to go and talk to it," said Ron 
very seriously. 

Harry tried to take a more active role in the conversation 
between them. 

"Blimey," said Ron, as they reached the entrance hall. 

"You don’t think I like it here," said Harry. 

He looked down at the place where the dungeon had 
been and saw, with a kind of rush of pride, that there was 
a large, circular room with a magnificent marble 
chandelier hanging from the ceiling. 

“I’ll say it when you get back from the holidays,” said 
Ron, and he and Hermione carefully set off for the 
Great Hall, which was set against the backdrop of a 
crowded street full of onlookers. 

“Hang on,” said Harry, trying to sound as though he 
didn’t want to be overheard, when he saw Professor 
Dumbledore, accompanied by Professor Sprout, standing 
beside him. 

“They’re planning a feast,” Harry said. 

“They’re planning a feast?” 

“I dunno,” said Ron, looking up at the ceiling over the 
table. 

“Hermione, they’re planning another feast too,” said 
Hermione, looking interested. “They’ve got a 
very nice little party tonight.” 

“Oh,” said Ron, looking down at the ceiling. “Oh, I 
haven’t seen anyone.” 

“Yeah, we�
====================
“What’s going on?” 

“Well, it’s been a bit of an uproar,” said Fred, 
“especially from the Quidditch team.” 

“It’s not about his health.” 

“It’s about the school,” said Fred, with a horrible 
look at the pair of them. 

“You’re not going to be able to do the Keeper’s job, 
aren’t you?” Ron asked, and Harry thought he saw 
the look of surprise on Fred’s face. “You’ve got to 
get that snout shape changed.” 

He pointed his wand at the foot of the bed, 
pointed it at the door on the right-hand side, and 
said, “ Level 4.” 

Ron opened his mouth. 

“Level 4?” 

“No,” said Ron, but he was not listening to the sound 
of the endearments moving out of sight. 

“I thought we were practicing with the Snitch?” 

“Yeah,” said Harry. 

“What’s this?” Harry asked, expecting Ron’s 
immediate reply, but instead it was the sound of 
the cold barrel of butterbeer that filled the space 
between the curtains. 

“The Snitch,” said Ron, “we’ve been practicing with 
it for ages.” 

Page | 515 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Harry heard Lupin lean closer to the door and 
look into it. Ron was looking at the silver- and black- 
threaded knitting needles in the corner of his 
face, but Lupin was looking at the long lines of 
Page | 516 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




what looked like under the surface of the butterbeer. 



“Well, we’ve only been practicing with the Snitch for 
====================
“What about you?” 

“We’ve got to be more careful,” said Harry, “because we 
need to know what the Horcrux is.” 

“Oh,” said Dumbledore. “Yes,” he added, and he 
stared around the office to check that the whole 
office was quiet, “I’ve been wondering, quite a while now, 
whether you might be able to speak to me about 
what we’ve been doing. Did you say to me, 
Dumbledore, to allow me to speak to you?” 

“No,” said Harry, and he broke off again. “Yes, 
Harry.” 

“I’ve been wondering whether you might be able 
to speak to me about the Horcruxes.” 

“Yes,” said Dumbledore, moving closer to Harry. 
“Well, I think it would be better if you could speak to 
me, as I am currently Headmaster.” 

“I know what you are trying to do,” said Harry. “Hide 
my face from view, to prevent me from seeing the Horcrux. 
You are hiding my face, you know.” 

“Well, I’m afraid I’m afraid of what you are going 
to be able to do.” 

“Hide?” 

“Hide?” 

“Well, the point is, they’ve got to be. You’re supposed 
to be in the Ministry of Magic, remember?” 

“Yes,” said Dumbledore. “Yes, they’re supposed to 
have a Ministry of Magic.” 

Page | 738 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“What are they supposed to be?” asked Harry. 



“Well, they’re supposed to be able to — ” 

“They’re supposed to be able to speak to,” said
====================
“I’d better 
think about getting it in time. I’ve got 
several more hours left.” 

Harry had a feeling it was a lot easier to get 
this one done, in case he needed it later. 

“That’s what I’ve been asking you to do.” 

“I’ve been trying to persuade you, you know.” 

“We’re not interested in getting it,” said Fred 
repentantly. 

“Well, if you’re interested in getting it, it’s in the 
Order’s plans,” said George. 

“So we’ll know what the Order’s doing as soon as we 
can!” said Fred, sounding slightly disgruntled. 

Harry stared at him, and at that moment, something 
happened to him. 



Page | 337 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“It’s a double victory,” he said, pulling out his wand 
and indicating the third time. 

“I knew it!” said Angelina10, who was watching 
Fred and George give their final instructions. “We’re 
going to have to start with the basilisk.” 

“Right,” said George, and they left the room. 

The basilisk was circling the room again, and when 
the door had opened again, it said, “Expecto Patronum 
V’ 

“” said Harry, sitting up. 

“You’ll see,” said Fred. 

“You’ll,” said George softly. 

“And we’ll be able to wipe the Mark on it, but we’re 
not going to be able to do anything with it, not when we’ve 
got the basilisk.” 

“D’you think we’re going to get rid of it?” Charlie 
said, his
====================
“You’re going to have to go to the hospital wing,” he said, spotting Honeydukes on the floor beside the door. “You’ve got to change your bedding.” 
“Oh,” said Harry, though he could not think why Dumbledore would 
want to change bedding. 

“I wouldn’t be surprised if you need to go there,” said 
Dumbledore, and he moved quickly toward Honeydukes, 
which was examining its beak, then backed out of the 
way, landing in a room full of people staring at 
him. 

“Dumbledore,” said Dumbledore quietly, “you’ve got to 
come down to the hospital wing, because there’s a 
need to wait outside the door. If the door bursts open 
you’ll need to get inside.” 

“Oh,” said Harry, looking around at the floor. He had 
realized that the hospital wing had already been booked 
for a trip to the hospital wing, and that if he 
passed the Dark Mark in the grounds he would be 
returning to the Dursleys’. He had also noticed that 
Dumbledore was wearing his best hat, which was 
made of scarlet silk; he actually looked very handsome. 

“I’m sorry,” he said. 

“I’m sorry you’re so late. I thought you’d come down 
for the ride.” 

“No, I’m not.” 

“I thought you’d come down for the ride. You’re a bit 
preoccupied. ...” 

“No ... I’m perfectly fine. I’ve got to come down for 
the ride.” 

“Oh, I’m just wondering why Dumbledore won’t 
come down for the ride. ... I mean, he’s a lot of fun. ...” 

Page | 574 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 





====================
“What’s that?” 

Harry did not answer. 

“It was a 

Page | 524 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




female elf.” 



“I’ve told you,” said Dumbledore. “The Dark Lord 
may have been a little jealous, thinking of marrying 
her.” 

“She’s not really a elf,” said the elf. “She’s 
from the Department of Mysteries. Anyway, 
there’s a funny way,” he added, as Harry pointed his wand 
at a strange sign on the back of a long-fingered 
handkerchief. “They’ve got to be pretty tall to have gotten 
into an argument.” 

“Oh,” said Harry. “Sort of crosses the line.” 

“Fred and George went to the Shrieking Shack,” said 
Dumbledore. “They’ve been looking for the Horcrux. 
If you’re wondering how the elf got the Horcrux, 
well, they’ve got to be about five foot three, but she’s 
strong and fast and she’s got a knack of turning things 
into grinds.” 

“Hmm,” said Harry, thinking of the elf. “I’ve 
got a point here.” 

“ ‘Mummified and remarried,’ ” said Dumbledore. 
“So we’re going to have to find a way around it.” 

“I’ve said that,” said Harry. “I think it’s a good idea if we 
go with the elf.” 

“I’ve said that,” said Dumbledore. “The Dark Lord 
sees her a little bit more seriously now, and I’ve been 
looking for the Horcrux for ages.” 



Page | 525 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows
====================
“Let’s get to it,” said Harry, and the room was empty. 

“Harry,” said Angelina, “let’s get to it, let’s stick together, 
we’re going to pass that memory.” 

“I’m sure you’ll,” said Harry, “but I’m afraid it’s the 
last one.” 

“Told you,” said Angelina, smiling. “Concentrated effort, 
but we’ll get you back.” 

“I’m sure you’ll go back,” said Harry, “trying to pass it a lot 
of the time. I’m sure it’s a good one.” 

“What?” said Angelina, looking all scandalized. “You’re 
passing the memory, aren’t you?” 

“I’m going to pass it,” said Harry. 

“I’ll,” said Angelina, “because I’m sure you’re going 
to pass it.” 

“Yeah — but you’re not going to pass it to me.” 

“Oh no,” said Harry, “well ...” 

He pulled out his wand. He felt it under his robes. 
He felt the place where the memory had vanished 
under the Cloak. He had seen it there before. Harry 
would never have believed that his Patronus had vanished 
from its hiding place. He had no idea what it would be 
when it was gone. 

“Expecto Patronur\” said Angelina, in a falsely low voice 
that made Harry’s stomach ache and the arm trembling with 
excitement. “Expecto Patronum Vos

====================
” 

Harry’s lips twitched. 

“The Dark Lord,” he said quietly. “He’s not 
thinking — ” 

“I thought he did,” said Ron, with a small 
shake of his head. 

“So we thought he’d come to see us,” said Harry, 
“and come back to find us here?” 

“No,” said Ron, “not yet!” 

“And what was his plan?” Harry asked, still 
thinking about the dream. 

“I’m sure it was a plan,” said Ron, “a clever one. 

“Oh yes, of course.” 

“And what did you say to him about being 
back on the map again, seeing him have such a good 
night?” 

“ I told him, if he didn’t come back to the Dursleys, I 
wouldn’t be surprised if he got killed,” said 
Harry. “But he was in the wrong place at the wrong time, 
and it was not a plan he was fond of running. He 
wants revenge for what happened to him.” 

Ron looked up. 

“Erm ... ‘The Dark Lord,’ ” he said softly, “is a 
plan. The plan to repel You-Know-Who.” 

“ ‘The Dark Lord is a plan,” said Ron, “and the Dark 
Lord has the means.” 

“So you’re saying the Dark Lord is a kind of 
spy?” asked Harry, who was looking at the letter. 

“Yes,” said Ron. He looked nervous. “I’ve never 
seen him use a spy before.” 

“Just like your father,” said Harry, “you’ve never spoken 
of it.” 



Page | 738 Harry Potter and the Death
====================
“I’ll be getting some sleep,” said Harry. 
“Listen to me,” said Ron. “Listen,” he thrust his hand into 
the air and began to climb into bed. 
“I was wondering what you’d call your usual snore 
suppression,” he said, pulling a small, beaded 
bag out of the bedroom door and rummaging in 
the bag for a new one. “You’ve got a younger sister, 
you’ve got an older sister, and you’ve had a very 
younger sister for a while. What’s the point of being 
making up old stories?” 

“I’m sorry,” said Harry. “I’ve thought it over for ages. 
You know what it looks like when you’ve been 
twitched.” 

“Yeah, well,” said Ron, turning to look Hermione 
and her sister closely. 

“Oh, I’m sorry,” said Hermione, “but you’re the 
first person in my family to go into hiding.” 

“You’re the first,” said Ron. 

“Yeah,” said Hermione. “You’ve got to be a bit 
bold, my dear, to say that.” 

“I’m not sure I’m brave,” said Ron after a minute or so, 
and they resumed their usual conversation on the 
floor. 

“I’ve heard that your mother died,” said Hermione, 
“and you’ve got a sister.” 

“I’m sorry,” said Ron, “but I’m sure her wasn’t 
really her — ” 

Page | 382Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“Then she was Death Eaters,” said Hermione, 
“and Lockhart was always in touch with her — ” 

�
====================
“That’s right,” said Harry, “that’s right.” 

“You’re not going to tell us anything, are you?” 
said Hermione, but she was distracted by the 
needling of a small, white, feathery, and hairy 
creature. 



Page | 823 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“Harry,” she said, “if it was only Dumbledore, if you 
were telling us what to do, we’d know exactly what to 
do.” 

“No,” said Harry, “no, he wouldn’t,” 

“But what amazes me about Dumbledore is the amount of 
evidence he’s given that you could have been 
killed. You’d have been, you’d have been a Death Eater, 
you’d have been trying to help the Order save the day! 
And he’s been very clear about what he’d done, how we 
should do it, and how we’d be prepared!” 

“He’s given us everything we’ve ever wanted,” said 
Hermione in a small voice. “He’s given us everything we 
need, and we’ve got to put that in writing.” 

“I think we’re best off without Dumbledore,” said 
Harry. “He’s got a job for us too.” 

“He’s not only the headmaster of Hogwarts, he 
has the authority to close Hogwarts.” 

“You’ve got to!” said Hermione. 

“I’m glad that’s the case,” said Harry. “I’ve got a 
great feeling about this one. If Montague’s been killed, 
if we’re going to have to split from the Order, if we’re 
going to fight, I think we’d better shut up now,�
====================
Harry had never seen Malfoy's face in all his life.

"Excuse me," he said, staring at Malfoy.

"He's not a Death Eater," said Malfoy.

"No, he's a Death Eater who was sent to kill me," said Harry.

Malfoy turned his face away from Harry again.

"What?" said Harry.

Malfoy's lips curled again.

"He's a Death Eater who was sent to kill me. I was only trying to
protect Dumbledore. He could have killed anyone if he'd been sent to
kill you.... You've got to remember that Dumbledore was a Death Eater,
and I was the one who made the connection between You-Know-Who and
Dumbledore."

"So?" said Harry.

Malfoy stared at him for a very long time. Then,

"He killed my sister. He killed my mother."

"He killed my mother too?"

Malfoy looked as though he didn't know what he was talking about.

"He wanted to kill you first. He wanted to kill you for someone else's gain.
For his own gain. He wanted to kill you for your own good."

"But he's not my father's favorite, is he?" Harry said, his voice
now that it was coming louder and louder.

"No, he's very fond of you. He told me he'd like to be your
second son, you know, maybe he'd like to be your father."

"But he's a Death Eater?" said Harry.

Malfoy spoke in his voice of honor and gratitude.

"Nope, I'm sorry, Harry. I was just saying he'd be very fond of
you. He's a Death Eater --"

"-- and he's not happy about it," Harry said later. "Haven't you
seen that picture of him with his father? He's holding up the
newspaper, he's talking about Dumbledore's meeting with the
Dark Lord."

"Who?" said Malfoy suddenly. "What did you say?"

"That picture of the Dark Lord --"

"-- and that picture of the Dark Lord? You're kidding --"

"My father's meeting with the Dark Lord?" said Harry
====================
. . . ."  Harry was staring at the back of the chair, at the handsome man, who had turned a great, dark, black-haired man.  Then, as he looked quite straight ahead, he saw that the man was wearing a long black cloak with a large chest buttoned with a short-sleeved waistcoat.  He spoke very softly to a small man, who broke into a kind of silent laughter, and said,  "Muttering. . . . "
"Muttering?" said the man.
"Well, I think I do," said the black man.  "I can hear you.  You're here, I got a letter from you."
It was the letter from Tonks.
Dear Mr. Potter, 

I have just received a message concerning a supposed advertisement for a shoe company.  I am disappointed in myself and in Mr. Tonks.  I have worked very hard to impress upon Mr. Tonks that I can be of use to him.  I know that I can be a bit of a prat and a chameleon, which I have always been rather prone to.  He is a great Muggle-born, of course, and would be perfectly happy to take you on as he sees fit.  However, I must be honest, I have been under intense pressure from people who are very interested in my career.  I have been under constant criticism from those who are most interested in my future.  Some members of the public seem very interested in what I have learned after completing my B.A. in Ancient Runes.  I have been receiving very little writing in the hope of persuading members of the public to sign an open letter.  I have had plenty of criticism from the people who are most interested in my future.  I hope to be able to persuade members of the public to give their thoughts in the mail.  I have been getting huge support from you all, Harry.  I hope to have your support in the coming year.  I will keep trying to persuade people to sign an open letter.  I have been getting very little publicity.  I have got very few followers.  I think I might have been out-of-print before I got off the ground.  I think some of the people who have liked me for a while might still like to know more.  I am hoping that you will give them the
====================
“Never!” 

“Never!” said Hagrid loudly. 

“If you say so, we’ll have to move it!” 

“Where’s the password?” 

“What’s the password?” 

“Bin’ eggs,” said Hagrid, and he let go of the 
chick’s neck. “Birds of a feather, you know.” 

“But we don’t want them grazing on what we’ve 
got around here,” said Ron, looking abashed. “We want 
the egg on the bird’s head.” 

“You know what?” said Hermione, a little 
deeper, “Hogwarts’ isn’t that far away for some 
reason, is it?” 

“No,” said Hagrid, “it’s a private area. There’s a 
connection between the eggs and the Gryffindor common 
room. We’re going to need to add some more security.” 

“But we need to keep them out of trouble,” said 
Hermione sharply. “We’ve got to protect our new 
enumeration, which is ‘eggs’ — ” 

“Just use ‘egg’s’ instead of ‘bacon,” said 
Hagrid, but before he could answer, Hermione 
jumped again, and he turned to Harry, who was 
taking a better look at the Gryffindor common room 
instead. 

“You want this unbreakable password, Hagrid?” 

“Yes,” said Harry, “but we always want to be sure we 
need to change it.” 

“I know.”

“I know,” said Hagrid, “but you’d need to

“Well, I’m sure you’d want to know the answer,” said 
Professor Umbridge. “But it’s really quite a question of 
what the game is going to be for Voldemort. I don’t 
think we’re going to be able to persuade him to play 
a little more freely.” 

“Well, I’m sure you’ll play him a little more freely, 
eh?” said Harry. 

“Well, nothing too spectacular,” said Professor 
Umbridge, “but I think we’re going to be able to persuade 
Voldemort to play a little more freely.” 

“And what do you think, Harry?” 

“Well, I’d think it would be a shame to see him lose the match, 
because Luna Lovegood’s about to be sentenced to death,” 
said Harry, “but I suppose we’d better allow him to play 
a little more freely than he’s playing now — ” 

“He’s about to be sentenced to death?” 

“I think it would be a shame to see him lose the match,” 
said Harry. 

“Very good,” said Professor Umbridge, looking 
over her shoulder at Lucius Malfoy. “I think we 
should all do that.” 

“I think we should give him a chance,” said Harry, 
shaking his head impatiently. 

“I have no wish to win,” said Professor Umbridge, 
“and neither do I.” 

“We’re not playing against you, Luna,” said 
Professor Umbridge. 

The class laughed. 

“You’ve got to be kidding,” said Harry, who had 
been thinking this for a long time. “Because of what happened 
today, of course.” 

“
====================
“I’ve got the full story,” said Harry, “and I’m going to go and tell Ron and Hermione about it.” 

“They’ll be in a hurry,” said Hermione. “They’ll be doing some 
work.” 

“Yeah, well,” said Harry, “if they’re working something 
important or — ” 

“No, no,” said Hermione, looking alarmed. “That’s 
not important.” 

“But what’s important is I’ve got the whole story,” said 
Harry. 

“Well, I’m going to ask them,” said Hermione, “whether 
you’re telling the truth about what happened at 
Hogwarts.” 

“And why?” 

“I don’t think it matters much, I can’t tell them 
anything, but I think they’re all a load of rubbish. 
They’re really frightened and scared, and they’re 
asking questions, not just “ ‘I don’t know,’ ” but 
“ ‘I don’t care how much you’re scared of Hagrid, he 
was a good bit of a nutter when he was at school, he’s 
not a good bloke.” 

“Well, I’m just going to say this,” said Hermione, 
“we’ve got to keep an eye on the school governors.” 

“We’re all scared,” said Ron, looking out of the window. 
“If they run afoul of Hagrid, we’ve got to stick up for 
him.”

“We’re in a bit of a bind,” said Hermione. “There’s an 

Umbridge inquiry and then there’
====================
“Did you want to come to our wedding?” asked Luna, looking 
around the room. “It’s just you and that book.” 

“It was a good one!” said Luna, when Harry had 
reacted to Luna ’s lack of interest in the details. 
“And you’d have to get that book before the wedding 
night, because they’ve already booked the next one, 
you’d need that book!” 

“I thought you were going to be able to get a bit of a 
present from the Burrow?” said Luna, looking back at 
Harry, who was looking rather pleased. “Is it — ?” 

“Oh, we’ve been trying for ages to get this done,” said 
Harry, throwing his answer away. 

“But we’ve been talking to them about getting it done,” 
said Luna, “and we’ve got to make sure we’re getting the 
right fit for you. We’re going to be married in the 
pleasure garden.” 

“But that was our idea!” 

“We’ve got to make sure we’re getting the right fit for you, 
Harry,” said Luna, smiling. “I can’t wait to see 
you at the wedding.” 

“I’ve got to.” 

She carried a handkerchief from her bag and strode 
past the door, her wand pointing out of the window 
at the Burrow.

“All right,” said Harry, “but we haven’t got time to 
conceal, and we’ve got to do what you’ve said!” 

“All right then,” said Luna, and she pulled out a 
letter from inside her robes. 

“It’s been sent to us by Miss Granger.�
====================
” said Harry. 

“But I think I’d better go and look for the 
Invisibility Cloak,” said Dumbledore. 
“It’s been a while since I’ve seen it, you’re 
right,” said Harry. 

Dumbledore pointed his wand at a small 
hole in the wall of parchment that had been 
extinguished by a number of deep black lines. 

“Harry, I’m going to try and touch it once, but I’m not 
going to try.” 

“You don’t want to know, Dumbledore!” 

“I know I’m getting better, but I think I’m going to 
try and find the Cloak first.” 

Something flew from the tip of Harry’s wand 
and landed upon the Invisibility Cloak. He looked 
for it again. 

“You’ve got to be kidding,” said Dumbledore, 
“that’s what I’m going to try and catch it. The 
Clankers. Dumbledore, wait here for me.” 

“I’ve got to go to Sirius,” said Harry. 

“Yes,” said Dumbledore, “I’ve got to go to the 
Inferius, but I’m not going to try and catch the 
Cloak.” 

“You’re right,” said Harry. “I’m sure I can catch the 
Cloak.” 

Dumbledore raised his wand, pointing it at the 
Inferius behind it, who had appeared to be 
ruining its decoration. 

“You have the Cloak,” he said, waving it. “It 
feels great. I’ll try and catch it once.” 

“But you’re losing track of how to do it,” said 
Harry. 

“I’ve got a theory,” said Dumbledore. “Why would 
you want to

going and do it tomorrow,” he said, “I’ve got an 
order, Dumbledore has told me.” 



“You’re going to have to be a bit more careful,” said 
Slughorn, his black eyes twinkling from unfocused 
focus behind his pointed nose. “I can’t wait to see 
you.” 

“The Order of the Phoenix is going to meet again tomorrow, 
so don’t get too excited,” said Dumbledore. “It’s a 
matter of life and death.” 

“But I don’t want to get ahead of myself,” said 
Slughorn. “The third meeting’s going to take place in 
a week — not bad, really.” 

“Dumbledore’s sending you letters,” said Harry, 
wondering why he seemed to be getting so much 
faster than he had in the past. 

“I mean,” said Slughorn, “Listen to this. I’m 
going to come and see you this evening.” 

Dumbledore smiled, but there was a look of 
disappointment on his face. 

“Can’t come to see you,” he said, blushing. “I’ve 
got to go and see Madam Pomfrey.” 

“Oh,” said Harry, “can’t go to Pomftey’s. ... It’s 
all going to be packed with us.” 

“I want to go to Madam Pomfrey,” said Dumbledore 
pleasantly. 

“You’re going to be packed too,” said Slughorn. He 
wrestled his hair casually in his hands and 
hoisted himself down on a chair. “It’s going to be 
really crowded, I’
====================
” 

“I’m sorry,” said Tonks. 

“It’s fine,” said Professor Umbridge, “and obviously you’d 
have to ask Snape to do it before we’re allowed to ask 
him.” 

“Oh, I’ll do that,” said Professor Umbridge with a 
shudder. 

“Yes,” said Professor McGonagall, “but I think it 
will be most interesting to see whether Snape calls 
Snape after him at the end of every lesson.” 

“Oh, he does,” said Professor McGonagall. “He 
says he’s going to ask you in front of Snape, gives 
you a bezoar.” 

Professor Umbridge did not answer at all, but looked 
around and said, “You’re well?” 

“I’m fine,” said Professor McGonagall. “I’m Sirius 
Black.” 

“Yes, because you’re here,” said Sirius, “and I 
was going to ask him if he’s ever asked you to do anything 
else this year.” 

Professor McGonagall looked astonished. 

“Yes, I’m sorry,” said Professor McGonagall, glancing at 
herself in the direction of the bottom of the stack of 

Page | 496 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




questions. “Yes, I’ve — well, I’ve been wondering if 
you could do something for Black, but I haven’t got 
the authority to do it now. I’ve been trying for a while, 
but the only person who’s ever been able to help me 
was — and I’m sorry — Sirius Black was a Death Eater — ” 

“I’ve been wondering if you could help him,” said 
Professor McGonagall, and her voice was now so 
====================
“I’ve got very good news,” said Harry, now starting to get to sleep. “You’ve got a proper place to lay your head. I’ve got a place to sleep 
now.” 

The sound of his name echoed through the empty dormitory. 

Page | 555 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“I’ve got a place to sleep,” said Harry, and he waved his 
wand. 



He was halfway through pulling open the door of his 
room when he heard footsteps running up the stairs. 
He looked down and saw Ron’s bed, which was 
sitting on the opposite side of the room from his 
Dursleys’. 

“Dudley, come on,” said Harry, getting up, as 
Dudley’s footsteps from the stairs drew nearer, and he 
scurried over to the door, but Harry was too 
aroused to look at him. 

“Harry, you’re going to have to stay here for a week,” 
said Ron, who was standing behind Harry, “or I’ll 
put you in detention with the judge.” 

“I’m not going to judge,” said Harry, “I’m not 
going to judge.” 

“I’ll see you around soon,” said Ron, and he pulled 
out his wand again. 

“I’ll see you around,” said Harry. 

He felt his way across the room and out onto the 
floor.

“Good one,” said Ron, “I think I’ll come and sit 
with you by the fire.” 

“I’m starving,” said Harry. “I’m starving.” 

“You’re not starving, are you?” 

“No,
====================

“I know,” Harry told her, and she laughed. “I thought you 
could’ve seen the end of the Snatchers. ... I’d 
think you’d be able to see what they’ve been 
doing. ...” 

“What?” 

“They’ve been killing us,” said Harry. “They’ve 
been following us. ... Harry, if you’ve been 
following them, you’ve been spying on them. 



“But their witch’s eavesdropper — ” 

“I don’t think they’ve been spying on us,” said 
Harry. 

“But it’s our witch, isn’t it?” said Ron, “and she’s 
supposed to know everything we’ve done. ... And 
she’s supposed to know about everything, you know. 
Look, if — you know what we’ve done?” 

“There was a boy Potter knew,” said Harry. “He 
was the boy we had to watch for a while. ... I 
don’t think they’ve got it anymore. ...” 

“If we’re going to use the Death Eaters’ spells against them 
here,” said Ron, “we’ve got to be smart about it. ...” 

“But I’m not really worried about them,” said Harry 
quietly. “I’ve got a feeling they’ve been using a 
methodical and efficient way to come back. ...” 

Page | 597 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“I’ll keep my wand pointing straight at the ground,” said 
Harry. “If we’re going to use the Death Eaters’ spells 
against us, we’ve got to be smart
====================
“You’d better get going,” 
said Harry. 

“We’ve got to get going,” said Hermione, and she 
continued to stare at the door. 

“What?” said Harry, looking up at the ceiling. 

“Look,” said Hermione, in an oddly hopeful 
voice, “we need to talk about last summer.” 
“It’s been easy,” said Harry, looking up. 
“You know what the Quidditch pitch is like, you 
know what conditions are ideal for a run? We’ve 
got drills this summer, and we’ve been doing practice 
each day, and we’ve got some new tactics to think 
about, so we’ve got time to think about when we’re 
going to pitch — ” 

“Well, we’ve got the perfect time to talk about it,” 
said Hermione, “because if you don’t want to talk 
about it, then we’re not going to get it right the first 
time.” 



Page | 521 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Well don’t be stupid about that,” said Hermione 
severely. “It’s boring being boring, and we can’t 
have too many stupid conversations about 
Quidditch.” 

“Why not?” said Harry, who had been thinking of 
using ‘Quidditch’ to describe the sport’s most popular 
teammate, the highly popular and highly popular subject 
‘Quidditch,” but who was talking about the 
Quidditch pitch. “It’s not exactly a free-for-all, and we don’t 
want to have to think about Quidditch too much.” 

She looked away at the ceiling, and Harry stood 
looking at her instead. 

“Well, we were just wondering,” she said coldly, 
“
====================
uncle will be very happy indeed,” said Dumbledore, with relish. “Remember . . . your mother and I — ” 

“Well,” said Dumbledore, turning his back on Uncle Vernon’s 
insides, “we’re not complaining.” 

“We’re just glad we were spared the trouble of telling you 
that we’re not sending you any more trinkets.” 

“But we are not your family,” said Dumbledore, turning 
away again, “nor are we. We are your ancestors, and 
you are our goal.” 

“How do you reckon that matters?” asked Uncle Vernon. 
“He’s our grandfather, isn’t he?” 

“He’s there — ” 

“Why?” asked Dumbledore. “Because he’s the only 
one who was born here, and that’s the only one who was 
dead?” 

“Because he’s our father,” said Dumbledore. 
“And we’re his descendants, as he was the first to 
arrive in this land, and we’re the first to leave it.” 



Page | 845 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




“But we’re going to be our own separate family,” said 
Dumbledore. 

“Dumbledore,” said Uncle Vernon, stung, “please 
let’s leave, it’s time to go.” 

“Leave,” said Dumbledore, his voice cold and 
sneaking, “and be ready to move.” 

He turned to follow Dumbledore and followed Aunt 
Petunia out of the door, then followed Harry out of the 
way. 

“Here you are,” he said. “My son.” 

“Where’s my son?” repeated Aunt Petunia. “Where’s 
your son?�
====================
“How’ve you found out?” 

“Well, I’ve found out because you took that 
Patronus from your old teacher,” said Hermione. 
“I’ve been keeping a close watch on him, keeping 
sure that there’s something in there somewhere.” 

“Oh,” said Ron, “we haven’t got any proof either, 
though ...” 

“I’ve been keeping watch on him,” said Hermione 
sharply. “He’s been sending things off to the 
Quidditch team, and he’s been talking about it 
quite a lot lately. You’ve been keeping watch on 
him, haven’t you?” 

“Oh yes,” said Ron, frowning. “Yes, I suppose 
that fits with what we’re trying to do.” 

“Well, we’ve got to be careful,” said Hermione. 
“We’ve got to be careful about what we call ‘in’ out 
of the way.” 

“Yeah, well ...” 

“And you’ve been keeping watch on him too.” 

“Most certainly.” 

“I’ve got two Potions master’s orders,” said 
Hermione, “and one,” she paused, “to never use 
words like ‘out of the way” or ‘in” again. 

“And two,” said Ron, looking sulky, “to use the 
words ‘in” and ‘out” together. 

“I’ve been keeping watch on him,” said Hermione 
indignantly. “And one more,” she added, a little 
lumpy look on her face. Ron glanced at Hermione, then 
said, “Oh,” and stopped again. 

“Well, the others,” said Hermione, “are

” she said firmly, “I am not your servant. I am yours.” 

“I wish to speak to you,” said Harry, “of whom you are 
sick?” 

“I am your servant,” said Lupin. “I am born here.” 

“But do not despair,” said George. “Master’s return 
has been postponed.” 

“If you are ready to die, you are too.”

“You are not.” 



“I am not,” said George, and Harry felt sure that 
this was due to the fact that he felt much more 
hopeful than Ron that night. 

“I have your word that you will not attempt to 
transform.” 

“I cannot promise that we will not come.” 

“You are welcome to stay as long as you like, but we 
must keep our word that we will not allow anyone else to 
choose you.” 

“I am sure that you will be grateful for our help,” 
said Lupin. 

“I know that you will be devastated if anyone else 
ever chose to kill you.” 

“I am not your master,” said George, and Harry 
gasped for breath. “You are not your master.” 

Lost in his misery, he turned slightly pink at the sound 
of the name. 

“You are not his master,” said Lupin. 

“You are not his master,” said George. “You are not 
his master.” 

“But you are not his master,” repeated George, 
“you are not his master.” 

“You are not my master,” said George. “You are not 
my master.” 

“You are not my master,” repeated Lup
