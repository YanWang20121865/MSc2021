This time I updated the program for web scraping( including reddit API with PRAW, PushShift and wget), GPT2 training and text generation. And I uploaded the notebook.In the notebook, I also added some comments.

The dataset generated by the web scraping program was also uploaded to the document 'dataset'. I did not upload datasets that scraped from reddit because they are too large that Github doesn't allowed me to upload. I only uploaded the smallest dataset 'HarryPotter'.The text generated from trained GPT2 is also saved as a TXT file with timestamp, and I uploaded to a folder.
